""The Worried Coat"" out April 5th on Super Secret Records, was recorded in part in Mexico City courtesy of Richard Davies (The Moles) hand-me-down studio time and the other half at a ranch in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, Ostrar wrapped and warped his Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar around these groovy nuggets of capitalistic despair, cretinism, gas lighting, nationalism and nativism, false heroism, and that good-time tug-of-war (this game is rigged) called Inherited Wealth vs. Inherited Debt. But he wasn’t alone in making this album, so don’t worry too much about him. He brought along Michael Krassner (Boxhead Ensemble), Wil Hendricks (Califone), and Stephen Patterson (Hamilton Leithauser). 
This is Ostrar’s second solo album, the follow-up to 2017’s Brawls In the Briar. Before that, he led the early 2000 shag-carpet art-punk of Manishevitz, an early Jagjaguwar band that toured with The Mountain Goats and Edith Frost before the Internet tracked these things.

With his soulful vocals and crystalline melodies, the Fort Lauderdale-based singer/songwriter delivers an impassioned breed of indie-pop that melts away everyday worries and leaves the listener inspired to live more fearlessly.
Given their transportive power, it’s fitting that so many of Di Leo’s songs are sparked by his adventures in visiting new cities all over the country and across the globe. “I’m always most motivated to write when I’m in a place I’ve never been before,” says the 22-year-old artist. “Even just riding on the plane when I’m traveling somewhere new seems to do something to me, and the melodies just start to come together.”
On his new EP Strange Open Land, Di Leo channels that inspiration into an intricately detailed but hook-heavy sound. The follow-up to his debut EP So We Go—a 2016 release that landed Di Leo on the top 20 at more than 100 college radio stations around the U.S.—the EP also perfectly captures the infectious energy that Di Leo’s shown in sharing stages with such artists as Barns Courtney

49,Amy Wilcox,"It was 2014, and for the first time, Amy Wilcox felt her musical dreams were finally within her grasp. Years spent honing her craft as a songwriter and performer had finally brought her to this point – she was about to head out on her first national tour. She had been opening for Nashville staples like Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Kellie Pickler, and Brothers Osborne, while also commanding her own residency at Nashville mainstay, Third & Lindsley. As a principle character on A&E’s reality show, Crazy Hearts, the world got its first glimpse into the life of the burgeoning country music starlet. But just as Amy’s music was beginning to connect, life got in the way. Her engagement was called off, her future plans dissolved, and the turmoil brewing in Amy’s personal life crept into her craft. “I learned the hard way that not everything is meant to be. Sometimes timing is everything. After the dust settled, I struggled to reconnect creatively. I was in a very different place, and honestly it was really tough,” Amy recalls. Her relationship went south, but instead of dwelling on what might have been, Amy picked herself up and headed West, on a new journey of personal and artistic growth. L

These include being an advice columnist for the Village Voice and Vice Magazine, the host of a Cartoon Network children's game show, and giving motivational lectures on positive partying at Yale, NYU, Carnegie Mellon, and the U.K.'s Oxford University. As the prodigious piano playing party prophet nears his second decade of dynamic performance, his hard partying spirit shows no signs of slowing... or softening.

55,Andy Jenkins,"Hatched in the tradition of Southern culture—unhurried in his art, yet weirdly ahead of the curve by the time he arrives— Andy Jenkins is a joyously idiosyncratic songwriting talent, ripened over years of relative obscurity. 'Sweet Bunch' springs into the world fully-formed, sitting at the crossroads of modernism and timelessness, sensitivity and decision, with the expansiveness and musical drawl of Big Star, the bounce of John Prine, and the curly, perfectly-carved melodies of George Harrison. Each song paints a wild landscape, the mood of a sun setting on a damn good day among friends and favored creatures.

Andy is a kind of unheard counterpoint, originating from the same small scene of independent Virginia youth culture that produced artists like Justin Frye (PC Worship) Natalie Prass, and Matthew E. White, all friends from his teenage years. Produced by longtime collaborator White, with the Spacebomb crew and another old friend, Phil Cook, running hard into midnight, 'Sweet Bunch' was essentially recorded in three days of flow-state, with the drums, bass, keys, and guitars all live and nothing to regret. Backed by some ringers and a very full chorus, Andy’s warm words come bu

Angelica Garcia lends her astonishing voice to her poetically woven musings and statements of intent. In a time when music should stand up and isn’t, she’s an old head on young shoulders and a total anomaly.
After an unhappy period with a major label, 24-year-old Garcia has had a fantastic grounding in what not to do and has spent the past 2 years plotting her own sound and vision. The first fruits of her labour, the single ‘Karma The Knife” drifted out recently winning over people drawn to her beat-driven, sharp and persistently melodic pop music.  She’s extremely hard to compare, but there’s certainly elements of Beck, The Beastie Boys, Jack White and Kimbra all through Garcia’s particular kaleidoscopic worldview. 
An album is close to completion and is expected in early 2019.

has been backed across tastemaker platforms as one of the most vitally sarcastic voices in the indie scene, with praise coming from key press voices in The Independent, the Fader and The Line of Best Fit as well as on the airwaves. ‘Beat the Birds’, taken from 2018’s ‘Sorry I’m Not Perceptible’ EP, found its place on the Radio 1 BBC Introducing Playlist and she earned herself a spot on the lineup of BBC Music’s The Biggest Weekend in Swansea.

But that’s exactly where Apre’s story begins.  

Charlie Brown and Jules Konieczny were no strangers to making music individually, but it wasn’t until Sue who runs Ealing chess club (or, to use her full title “this legend called Sue”) suggested they should hook up and work together that the strands that make up Apre’s unique sound started to fuse together.

“She knew that we shared this passion for music and she paired us up,” recalls Brown, “we started playing together and found this love for the same thing.”

However, things didn’t quite immediately leap forwards from that moment to where we are today. Three years passed and Brown and Konieczn would spend their days playing in other groups, producing, working on other people’s material, making ends meet and trying to find their way in music. But something special kept bringing them back to t

Ari began uploading acoustic covers to YouTube in 2013, and developed her skill by practicing daily. That work paid off when Ari’s cover of “Timmy Turner” went viral and landed her some groove time with Desiigner on MTV’s “Critique My Cover”.

Isabel has been disobeying music all her life but it was in 2011, when she started her solo career, when we discovered that inside her head there was a melodic, kaleidoscopic, punk and unpredictable universe. A world in which Brian Wilson –in the melodies– and Leon Tolstoi –in the law-breaking final message– could happily walk hand in hand dancing to electronic rhythms. She called this personal project Aries (her zodiac sign) and under this identity she has already produced four albums. The latest one, “Juramento Mantarraya”, released by Spanish label La Castanya and K Records, is full of beautiful melodies, seemingly convoluted but at the same time very simple, where violins and flutes are mixed with abstract sounds. Aries creates an orchestra that generates an exciting mixture of free-jazz, soul and folk rhythms, melodies from the girl groups of the 60s, sunshine pop and experimental electronics.

Ask Arkansas Dave about growing up in a broken home, with fundamental Christianity on one side, and crippling drug-addiction on the other, and you can see in his eyes that this is no easy ride, and that at times music really was his only friend.
Chasing his dream of music, Dave played in bands, funding his music with a succession of jobs where he had to find his feet quickly – from busboy to assembly-worker in a trash-bag factory.
His wake up call came at the edge of a breakdown with a cataclysmic weekend epiphany. He headed home for a rare visit, and was persuaded to play a few songs to his family. The response he got from his grandfather sent his mind racing, only for him to find out the next week that his grandfather had died 24 hours later.
Determined to clean himself up, and sort his life, Arkansas Dave enrolled on an audio engineering course at Media Tech in Austin Texas, driving into town with a trailer loaded with all his possessions, ‘like something out of the Beverly Hillbillies’. And that’s where everything changed – the college was housed at that time in the f

They’re probably wearing the same clothes they had on yesterday, and reminiscing about last night’s gig. Inspired by a guitar lick that cuts to the bone or a melody that lingers on refrain, this band is following a path forged by countless other musicians who’ve lived and died in dive bars or ‘made it’ with their posters taped to bedroom walls. What makes this band of brothers any different? This band is The Artisanals. 
When Johnny Delaware moved from small town South Dakota to Charleston, SC he met Clay Houle and bassist Eric Mixon to form The Artisanals in late 2016. Now, with drummer Nick Recio, and keyboardist Ian Klin rounding out the group, The Artisanals have dropped the first ever record to come out of the Magic Barn - an Iowa studio-converted-barn that features the Neve console and gear from NYC's now defunct Magic Shop Studio. Utilizing everything from gong, organ, piano, sitar, french horn, trombone, and koto, to a string section sourced from a nearby University, every song on 'The Artisanals' (Sept 2018) self-titled LP is a straight banger.

He returns to that place—both creatively and physically—with his latest album, Immortal Americans. Written after a tumultuous period that found Lucas getting sober, supporting his partner through a battle with cancer, and breaking up with his longtime record label, Immortal Americans is a clear-eyed album for murkier times, rooted in stripped-down heartland rock songs that find the artist reflecting upon the changes in both his hometown and himself. It’s also Lucas at his most honest, rooted in a string of largely unamplified anthems that don’t rely on electricity to pack a punch. “I was watching the changes in Bloomington and reflecting upon the changes in my own life,” he sums up.“ Not all of this is happy stuff, but there’s hope. There’s light in the darkness. I really do believe in second and third chances, because I know how many chances I’ve received. You have to keep fighting.""

The beats blast like cannons while the guitars stampede like spooked stallions surging ever onward, snorting, snarling and tearing apart everything in their path.
The past year has seen Avalanche Party tear away from the moors, raising venues all around the UK and Europe to the ground with intense live performances, including Reading & Leeds Festival and a headline performance at Isle of Wight Festival.

97,BABii,"BABii is a small girl who makes big noises. When left unattended, she produces all her own beats, writes all her own words, makes all her own pictures and uses all her limbs and voice when she plays live. If not watched carefully BABii will write song after song, to the point where some have been put away for when she is older. The first of these songs will be heard on her debut LP ‘HiiDE’, out in 2019 on Deathwaltz Originals which was in parts co-produced by Adrian Sherwood and focuses on the key themes of hiding and secrets. Some tracks have already snuck out in strange forms on Iglooghost’s Diplo & Friends mix for BBC Radio 1 and have been heard while supporting him on tour around the UK. BABii recently made new friends with Iglooghost, umru, Kai Whiston and Abi Wade but having been left unsupervised they created more songs, some of which can be found on the internet, others of which are still HiiDDEN.

98,Baby FuzZ,"Doing what many only threatened to do, in 2017 songwriter Sterling Fox moved to Canada to protest the anti-environmental policies of the US government (among other things). A year later, he reemerged with Baby FuzZ, a bizarre alt rock/glam pop band with a rotating cast of contributors and members. Baby FuzZ's music fuses a number of styles from emo to rock and roll to creepy pitch shifted ballads. Described as “one of the most slept on acts in music” by Hillydilly, Baby FuzZ released a litany of brilliant singles in 2018 and drops a debut album Plastic Paradise on February 26. Baby FuzZ has also made a name as an enigmatic video artist, constructing some golden era MTV style music videos. Drawing comparisons to everyone from Billy Corgan to Elton John and Elliot Smith, it's hard to pin down exactly how to classify BF. In the past, Fox, the frontman of Baby FuzZ, produced “Video Games” by Lana Del Rey and has written for the likes of Madonna, Britney Spears, and Avicii, so there is a decidedly surreal pop sensibility to the weirdness. But with a charmingly punk ethos and a unique self produced album, Baby FuzZ just might be the strange new arrival the alt rock world needs.

99,Bad Bad Hats,"Bad Bad Hats is an indie rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band consists of Kerry Alexander, Chris Hoge, and Connor Davison.  Their music honors classic pop songwriting, with nods to 90s rock simplicity and pop-punk frivolity. Through it all, Alexander’s unflinchingly sincere lyrics cut to the emotional heart of things. The band's sophomore LP ""Lightning Round"", was released August 3rd, 2018. Producer and collaborator Brett Bullion (who also produced their debut album ""Psychic Reader"") encouraged the group to record live in the studio, an approach which lends many songs on the record a loose, organic feel. In this spontaneous environment, the music feels as honest and unpredictable as Alexander’s lyrics. Alexander is still writing love songs, ones that recount with cinematic swell the subtle joy and pain of the everyday. Bad Bad Hats has toured the U.S. extensively since 2015, including tours with Margaret Glaspy, Hippo Campus, Third Eye Blind, The Front Bottoms, and more.

After years knocking around the Washington, D.C. punk scene in bands of their own, guitarists Katie Park and David Combs, bassist Emma Cleveland and drummer Daoud Tyler-Ameen began playing together in 2015, with a few goals in mind: Songwriting would be collaborative, singing would be everyone's job and arrangements would be generously staggered, blending voices and ideas to avoid centering any one member.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Punk,Power Pop,"Washington, DC","Mar 14, 2019",12:15am-12:55am,Malverde,False
101,Bad Sounds,"Bad Sounds- formed by Bristol-based brothers Ewan and Callum Merrett started out on different musical paths before Bad Sounds was born. Ewan made hip-hop beats and played with samples, while Callum was working in recording studios and obsessing over the music of Michael Jackson, Curtis Mayfield, Beck and Flaming Lips. Combining their different loves, Bad Sounds are conjuring their own unique pop magic.
Annie Mac picked five of the band’s songs as her Hottest Record in the World, and landed 3 BBC Radio 1 daytime playlist adds. It’s no surprise Bad Sounds are a firm radio favourite; their big pop anthems, brimming with huge choruses, hooks powerful enough to fell tower blocks, and inspiring lyrical messages, bear loud repeated listening. 
The band’s live show is becoming a word-of-mouth sensation as they turn every show into a full-on party, and creating a colourful subversive experience for the audience.

Raised in New York City by their classically trained parents, siblings Daniel, David and Julia Bailen (fraternal twins and younger sister, respectively) immersed themselves in a record collection that included Simon & Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, Carole King and The Band. 
Even though they finish each other’s sentences, dissolve into laughter and tell hilarious contradicting childhood stories, BAILEN’s highly collaborative songs and visceral harmonies are formed by three very different individuals. They’re inspired not only by literature and a love of language, but also a myriad of classical and pop influences. Their musician parents didn’t push their kids. “They never said, ‘Guys, music is a viable option for a career,’” Julia explains. “I think they just showed us what the life of a musician was by example.” David affirms, “They normalized it.”

106,Balto,"""Balto sound like the kind of band you’d want playing in the background as you cruise down the highway with a road soda clutched in your hand."" - What Youth 
Following an ill-fated six-month stint as a copy editor and telemarketer in Moscow, guitarist and songwriter Dan Sheron returned to the US and recorded a record. The debut garnered the attention of dozens of blogs and publications worldwide as an underground songwriting gem of 2011. 
Over time, Balto transformed from a songwriting vehicle into a rock n roll band – performing a swaggering style of American music rooted at the intersection of Motown, Big Star, Plastic Ono Band-era Lennon, and Jackson Browne. Numerous releases followed upon which the band toured the lower 48, Alaska, Europe, and Russia and joined national acts (David Nail, The Revivalists, Blind Pilot, The Current Swell, etc) all over the West. Their live performance has drawn comparisons to fiery indie rockers My Morning Jacket and Wilco, while Seattle-based curators Artist Home describe 2017's LP Strangers as “a tangle of beautiful, messy emotions, wrapped up in a sound that’s warmly familiar yet brimming with soul and tiny details that are touched by magic.

107,Balún,"Brooklyn-based electronic indie band Balún self-identify as transnational. Balún’s sophomore album Prisma Tropical focuses an incredibly wide field of genres and influences into a revelatory sound that evokes both of the band’s homes and the distance between them. Heavy doses of tiple, bomba barrel drum, and dembow work alongside loops and layers of shimmering synths to accomplish something explicitly of the island, yet fluent in the language of global pop. Tied together around the magical realism of singer Angélica Negrón’s lyrics, Balún’s deep understanding of reggaeton's Jamaican dancehall roots has transformed their shoegaze pop into “dreambow.” Prisma Tropical was released July 20th 2018 via Goodchild Music and premiered on NPR’s First Listen. The album release saw Balún embark on a national tour including live recordings with KEXP and Audiotree. Prisma Tropical was one of NPR’s Top 50 Albums of 2018, placed #4 in Rolling Stone’s Top 10 Latin Albums of 2018, and The New York Times named “Años Atrás” one of the best 65 songs of 2018. In SXSW 2018 the band was selected as one of ""17 Acts That Stood Out"" by the New York Times.

108,Bambara,"Bambara is a post-punk band with Western overtones that meticulously integrates layers of noise into both their live set and studio output. As a three-peice comprised of twin brothers Blaze (drums) and Reid Bateh (vocals) and their childhood friend William Brookshire (bass), the band moved from Georgia to NYC to release their debut LP Dreamviolence, followed by Swarm in 2016. The significantly more expansive and refined sound captured on 2018’s Western Gothic concept album Shadow On Everything (Wharf Cat Records) has catapulted the band since its release.
Their pummeling, unpredictable live set has made them favorites in New York City. After opening for IDLES in Brooklyn, Bambara was immediately asked by the band to support them on their US tour. Additionally, Bambara has toured the US and Europe extensively alongside the likes of Metz, Girl Band, APTBS, Liars, Nothing, Algiers and more.

With the rugged power of a flashy Super Chief locomotive, the Banditos’ self-titled debut album bodaciously appropriates elements of ‘60s blues-fused acid rock, ZZ Top’s jangly boogie, garage punk scuzz a la Burger Records, the Drive-By Truckers’ yawp, the populist choogle of CCR, Slim Harpo’s hip shake baby groove, the ebullient folk of electric Dylan, gut bucket Fat Possum hill country mojo and the Georgia Motherf**king Satellites. From backwoods bluegrass, to slinky nods to Muscle Shoals soul and unexpected bits of doo-wop sweetness, the Banditos recall many, but sound like no one but themselves.

And on their debut LP Happy To Be Here, their multidimensional take on classic pop sounds awake and present, like a group that’s daydreaming but firmly there with one another. Barrie, the band, is primarily her project; on the record, which she co-produced with Jake Aron (Snail Mail, Solange, Grizzly Bear), Lindsay plays guitar, piano, synth and bass. But still, Barrie is distinctly not a solo project, and Happy To Be Here—out May 3, 2019 via Winspear—is very much a full band record. 
Happy To Be Here offers snapshots of the band coming together in the city, after having lived all over: Boston, Baltimore, upstate New York, London, São Paulo via Berlin. “The scaffolding of this album is moving to New York and finding these people that make up the band,” Barrie says. “We’re very different, but we cover each other’s gaps personally and creatively, and are eager to learn from each other.”

In 2015, the two friends met again, this time in California. They spent the summer closed in the childhood bedroom of Sam to write and record, and in a month's time they had finished their debut album, Vacation. 
After publishing a tiny experimental pop extravaganza titled ""Ciao for Now"", throughout 2017 and 2018 the duo tirelessly worked on ""Sleep"", their second LP, which was finally published last summer via La Barberia Records and legendary Slovakian cassette label Z Tapes. Sleep was premiered on HypeMachine, getting recognition from Rolling Stone among others, helping the duo getting hundreds of thousands streams on Spotify while touring both in Europe & Usa.

The result is a soundscape all her own—a slow, ice-cool Chattanooga drawl rapping through the distorted & progressive production from Suicideyear, London’s God Colony, & LSDXOXO— earning her features on The New Yorker, Pitchfork’s 10 Rappers to Watch 2019, Pitchfork’s The Best Rap Albums of 2018, Vibe’s Best Female Rap Albums of 2018, and FACT Mag's Rappers to Watch 2018.

Anyone can assume such a name, but Azniv Korkejian has an experience of what it means, the type of ground it covers. “Moving around so much caused me at some point to feel displaced, to not really belong anywhere and I thought that was a good title.” Her development was shaped by political landscapes and family opportunities, her adult life patterned by paths of her own. Born in Aleppo, Syria to Armenian parents, Korkejian spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia, moving to America when her family won a Green Card lottery. They settled in Boston, then Houston, but she split for L.A. as soon as she could. A casual offer to stay on a horse farm took her to the rolling hills of Lexington, Kentucky, followed by a year in Austin, and a trip east to Savannah for a degree in sound design. Returning to L.A., she discovered a close-knit community of musicians in Echo Park that started to feel like home. Maybe America is just a highway that leads back to L.A.

Synth and bass sounds in the single “Cursed” are noises from the echochamber-like geodesic domes of Teufelsberg, a Cold War-era listening station just outside the German capital. Exploring the point where acoustic recording and digital rendering meet, Beshken’s new work is an effective lesson in how field recordings, synthesizers, and introspective lyrics can fuse into a challenging, yet accessible format.

Influenced by the deadpan irreverence of The Monks and Talking Heads, Big Bill is known for their darkly comic, nervy take on punk rock, fully embracing the “all are welcome” vibe of punk circa the early 1980's, as embodied by Austin legends like Big Boys and The Dicks.  (There's also shades of Lou Reed, The Minutemen, and Violent Femmes.) Big Bill formed in 2011, though the seed for the band was planted years earlier, when the Braden brothers spent countless untrained hours piecing together music in high school. Even as the band's ambition grows, that Outsider Art element to their music lives on.

Big Bliss is the beautifully ruminating post-punk brainchild of brothers Tim (vox, guitar) and Cory Race (drums), later forming the band with friend and collaborator Wallace May (bass). After the 2016 release of their debut EP, Keep Near (Exit Stencil Records), motives and motivations shifted, and it became pretty difficult not to see the name Big Bliss on a show bill. Tireless efforts and undeniable passion on and off the stage landed the band on five tours, and earned them the title of Oh My Rockness’s ""Hardest Working Band of 2017.""

The first thing that you might notice is most likely the incredible quality of his productions, especially in terms of sonic aesthetics. For instance, his instrumental mixes are always very balanced and direct, with a really deep low end and a crunchy mid-range that adds a lot of excitement to the track. In addition to that, the treble range is smooth and bright, adding a lot of silky edge to the mix.His tracks are always on the edge, as he goes the extra mile to push his creativity and always explore new ideas and musical arrangements to set the bar higher. In addition to creating world-class tracks, Billyracxx is also quite well-known for his amazing visual work. He is a talented creative director, and has the ability to match his sonic works with some really next-level visuals to go along with the songs. As a result, he was actually able to inspire a true national movement and prompt many people to follow.

Africa is everywhere in Brazil, and it pulses through the music on Quebra Cabeça (Puzzle), Bixiga 70’s second studio album for Glitterbeat, where two continents dance together across the black Atlantic.
The result still captures the incendiary excitement of Bixiga 70 live, but the freedom of the studio brings more shade and subtlety than before. The rhythms are more sinuous than ever, snaking through the funk in way that looks more to Ghana or Nigeria than Memphis or Muscle Shoals, while the horns strut in powerful harmonies. It’s music that forges connections and retraces history while sounding absolutely contemporary. But for Bixiga 70, African will always be the root, and Brazil its beautiful, vibrant flower.

Mother of My Children is a life chapter gently preserved, and the access listeners have to such vulnerability feels special and generous. We are left wanting more, and all signs point to Black Belt Eagle Scout just getting started.

From the start, its original four members found themselves naturally amalgamating elements of Post-Hardcore, Minimalism, New Wave, Krautrock, and Punk. To date, Blessed has released one single with Toronto's Buzz Records (Weaves, Dilly Dally, Greys), and two critically lauded EPs. The Fader wrote of the EP II: ""Dominated by the high-fructose riffing pioneered by Deerhoof, giving way to a darker, propulsive jam that's just as chaotic, yet well-controlled.""

Four out of Blessed’s five members cut their artistic and organizational teeth in a fiercely D.I.Y. community that developed in the most unlikely conditions. In the Fraser Valley’s sprawling collection of suburbs and farmlands, there is little cultural infrastructure. And there is even less municipal enthusiasm for the arts. It is a Lynchian setting that nurtures overt conservatism and covert creativity. Young Valley musicians were forced to creatively accommodate their burgeoning local music scene by whatever means available. They turned the basements of shared punk houses into venues.

179,Blood,"Blood is a jazz punk band from Austin, Texas that began in Tim O'Brien's Hyde Park bedroom in the Winter of 2017. After years of performing poetry and singing in experimental projects, Tim took to the bedroom with the sole intention of making a tape for his best friend in the grips of a long battle with depression. The result feels like an adolescent, whose broken into the Pentagon just to piss on the carpet and fulfill a uniform fetish with his father’s colleagues.
It is the collision...ahem collusion... of these dual energies which has ultimately expanded the project into a five piece jazz punk ensemble. At times the band sounds like the Talking Heads fronted by a murderous queer Black Francis. In other moments it sounds like Ian Curtis convinced that he sounds like Dionne Warwick; a crooning epileptic in a balladeer's ballgown. In a more general sense, the members of Blood have been brought together by a mutual instinct to curate a perverse love affair between noise and pop music.
Regardless of how much vitriol the band has allowed to seep from the stage, one can at all times feel a greater sense of militant naivety which guides the bands every move.

Born and raised in New York, Blu takes inspiration from the city's rebel culture in the '70s.

Blu picked up the bass at 7 years old. She quickly educated herself and mastered bass lines from songs by Prince, Sly and the Family Stone, and CHIC. Messing around on her Dad's Technics turntables helped spark her youthful interest in DJing. At 17, Blu started DJing clubs around the city, becoming a fixture at House of Yes, underground warehouse parties, and pop up fashion events.

Their debut EP ""Tether"" was self-released in 2017, followed by their EP ""Weak"" on Austin Town Hall Records in January of 2018. Gaining infectious momentum, Blushing have since been asked to play Athens Pop Fest and have shared stages with the likes of La Luz, Sunflower Bean, Broncho, Snail Mail and more.
Their latest single ""The Truth"" showcases a growth in the band's expansive, cascading sound laden with ethereal vocals and fervent guitar, simultaneously capable of reining in with emotional and melodic space.

Davey’s dad (violin) and his mum (clarinet) both played, and met, in the BBC National Orchestra Of Wales. Davey himself also enjoyed orchestral engagement, playing in various Welsh Orchestra’s and Jazz bands as a teenager.
Davey’s vocals and arrangements carry the tunefulness of The Super Furry Animals. But the palette extends far beyond singer-songwriterly poignancy. Davey recruited friends Daf Davies, Dylan Morgan and Sam Barnes to form the Boy Azooga live quartet, an ensemble that swings smoothly from filmic instrumentals to a churning, rave-tinged rock that hints at both Can and their progeny in Tame Impala.

Under her songwriting moniker Boy Scouts, the Bay Area artist has spent over a decade refining her craft, penning heartbreak confessionals over glitchy drum loops since Myspace days. It wasn't until 2015 that Vick put together a live band and became a staple of San Francisco and Oakland lineups.
On her forthcoming album, it feels like Boy Scouts has truly arrived. Recorded and produced by Stephen Steinbrink, every element exists purely to serve the songs - the bass lines bounce and guitars are lush, but nothing gets in the way of Vicks true superpower, her voice. Delicately layered harmonies exude an effortless grace, and make the most casual lyrics hit the hardest. There's something so honest about her songs, they feel like late night therapy sessions with your best friend.

Made up of vocalists and multi-instrumentalists John Davidson and Jacob Bryant, and drummer Trevor Davis, the Brummies have been playing together in various incarnations since high school. The members count the Beatles, Elton John, ELO, Blitzen Trapper and My Morning Jacket among their influences, but also have an affinity for sweeping film soundtracks, a passion that informs Eternal Reach.
Recorded at Battle Tapes Recording in Nashville with engineer Jeremy Ferguson and co-producer David Hopkins, Eternal Reach now serves as the Brummies' stunning calling card.

The duo -- self-described as a ""primal industrial blues band"" -- has managed to gain the recognition of underground luminaries like Henry Rollins, and has toured both the United States (every year for the past 14 years) and Europe with A Place To Bury Strangers, Guerrilla Toss, The Sediment Club and ONO - their live shows are possibly even more energetic than their breakneck recordings. In performance, vocalist/synthethist/percussionist Billy Brat will flail around the room, brandishing his iconic serpent-like facial expression -- tongue out, eyes rolled into the back of his head. Terry Turtle dawns his signature mask and chain mail, his acoustic guitar hangs low around his neck and is adorned with a hallucinatory painted finish; he's a stoic figure while Billy thrashes about the stage.
Musically, Buck Gooter's sound is filled with manic howls, melodic synth sequences, crisp and pummeling drum machines, and highly distorted guitar, resulting in a cacophonous punk-industrial haze a la Nine Inch Nails, Iggy Pop and Grinderman.

Whether it’s The Beach Boys, Bee Gees or First Aid Kit, that sibling vocal blend is the secret sauce in some of the most spine-tingling moments in popular music. The Cactus Blossoms – Minneapolis-based brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey – offer compelling evidence that this tradition is alive and well, with a deceptively unadorned musical approach that offers “creative turns of phrase, gorgeous harmonies, and an ageless sound” (NPR All Things Considered), not to mention spine tingles aplenty. Their 2016 debut You’re Dreaming, a stunning and transporting collection of original songs, earned high praise from Rolling Stone and Vice Noisey, tour stints with Kacey Musgraves and Lucius, and a perfectly cast performance on the third season of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks. Now their unlikely rise continues with new album Easy Way, to be released on their own label Walkie Talkie Records.
While many bands would have been content to stick with the winning formula of their debut, the Blossoms refused to repeat themselves. If You’re Dreaming celebrated their vintage country and rock influences, Easy Way reveals a songwriting style that has changed, evolved, and gotten more modern.

249,Casii Stephan and the Midnight Sun,"Casii Stephan has a voice that you won’t soon forget. With comparisons to Florence Welch, Fiona Apple and Carole King, her voice will envelop your soul like a “warm blanket” (Tulsa World).

253,CASTLECOMER,"Castlecomer has never been lacking when it comes to drive and ambition, & their tenacious belief in the potential of their band goes all the way back to its earliest days. Consisting of four cousins & their best friend, the group began playing live during their teenage years & took their band name from a plaque mounted outside their grandfather’s house, one they later found out referenced the Irish village his family had emigrated from. Much like the band’s music, their name possesses deep personal meaning while still retaining an air of evocative mystery, hinting at places they’ve never been but still somehow course through their veins. Australia’s in their blood, too, and Sydney will always be home, but after signing with Concord Records, the band took a leap of faith in early 2018 and moved to the US. One listen and you’re hooked, sucked into their rapturous world of angular guitars and hypnotizing grooves. With a sound this meticulous and infectious, it’s hard to believe that the band has only just released their debut album, but the album is only the tip of the iceberg from a group that’s doggedly determined to fulfill every bit of their seemingly limitless potential.

255,Catastrophie,"Why do we wear masks? To do and say things we otherwise could not. Catastrophie is not a band, exactly: it’s a front, led by one woman’s voice through kinetic, fluid tracks. The collaborators have known each other since childhood, and are finding new ways to get under each other’s skin. With that deep familiarity comes peril—how do you say what you’ve never been able to say before?
One answer comes in the music of Catastrophie, which finds the means for both confession and remove, tragedy and irreverence, lightness and friction. The songs are stratospheric, fueled by the pressure of holding in emotions that aren’t allowed out, but float back to earth to confess the tenderest needs. The choreographed live shows veer into improvisation and infectious dance, and the videos are buoyantly glib—but dead serious.
If Catastrophie is a mask, a mythical feminine who fears and invites chaos, it’s a mask that allows her to be startling in her directness, and to deliver lyrics with unaffected candor and a hint of wounded malice.

They have garnered acclaim for being the first band to ever wear suits on stage. You will see them wearing their signature handsome-boy suits (unisex) during their live performances. Ceramic Animal's live show is known for being very slick as they cast an almost angelic aura whilst they perform their most righteous of numbers. Many a tear hath been shed upon sight of the sultry suit slinging sons of psychedlium.
Though they claim to be ""independent"", it is speculated that Ceramic Animal is actually a corporate plant by Big Suit and the suit lobby.

It was clear from the release of Chastity’s first demos that this was not “another punk band that can operate at only one speed.” Always concerned with the trending lack of accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces for the arts, the first Chastity show was held in Williams’ own bedroom where, packed wall-to-wall, the police were quickly called. But after the project’s second show supporting DC punk band Priests, Chastity was off to the races, sharing stages with the likes of with Metz, Chelsea Wolfe and Fucked Up. All without a full length recording out.
Released summer 2018 with Brooklyn Label Captured Tracks, 'Death Lust' follows the plot of suffering to survival. The album begins on a tortured note with ‘Come’ and builds toward the plummeting finale of ‘Chains’, evolving from start to finish in a crescendo of severity. Pitchfork calls Chastity's music 'the Smashing Pumpkins if they’d signed to Dischord'.

You might think the two tumultuous years since would have driven the band toward even more explicitly topical commentary. But as singer/guitarist/founder Clementine Creevy began writing the first of some thirty songs that would make up the new Stuffed & Ready, she found unexpected inspiration by turning inward. That meant leading her band somewhere new and writing songs that would reveal aspects of herself she realized she’d once concealed. 
Apocalipstick sizzled with Creevy’s confidence, vision and fiercely idiosyncratic personality. Stuffed & Ready announces Creevy as a songwriter newly tempered and strengthened by coming to terms with her own uncertainty confusion and anger. It’s her go-for-broke honesty that gives Stuffed & Ready its power and gravity. “I am telling my story of how I feel and where I am in life,” she says. “I’m exploring my own self-doubt. I’m confused about what happiness is and I’m searching for my place in the world. With Apocalipstick, I was an over-confident teenager trying to solve the world’s problems.

Cimafunk is a cimarrón (fugitive slaves who settled in the wild to lead a free life in Cuba), a free being defying classification, a pilgrim in search of new musical miscegenation and the reunion of black music. He believes in nothing but the power of the Groove and the cathartic communion of dancing bodies.

Singer, composer and producer, Cimafunk offers a subtle and bold mix of funk with Cuban music and African rhythms, a life-affirming sound, a UFO in the island's music scene.
His debut album ""Terapia"" (Independent Production, 2017) and especially his electric live shows are inexorably conquering a multitude of audiences from Havana to Paris. He broke attendance records in iconic venues such as the Fabrica de Arte Cubano, El Sauce and La Tropical.
Cimafunk is the winner of the Havana World Music Festival “Primera Base” Contest. In 2018, he was awarded the Cuerda Viva Awards (category “New Artist”) and his videoclip for “Me Voy” was elected Most Popular Video of the Year for the Cuban Lucas Awards.

309,Claire Morales,"""...All That Wanting takes on a theatrical sweep and rock & roll edge as Morales delivers her dusky ruminating with a quaver somewhere between Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush."" - Rolling Stone
Listen if you like: Angel Olsen, PJ Harvey, Mazzy Star.
Born to a family of artists and musicians, Claire Morales began playing music and making visual art at a young age. By middle school, she was performing her first solo sets at coffee shops, armed only with her father’s 1960s Gibson J-45 and a voice that many well-meaning people throughout her life would deem “more powerful than I thought it would be, looking at you.”  
Morales went on to form a band, making a sharp shift towards rock n roll while keeping a love for lyrics and a strong singer songwriter sensibility. In 2018, she released her second full length album, All That Wanting. There is a vast sonic range across the work—a kind of genre defying fearlessness, passing fluidly between moments of intense drama, fuzzy psychedelia, poppy fun, quiet reflection, and cathartic release. Morales toured the US with her band last year to promote the new album with plans to tour more in 2019.

311,CLAVVS,"CLAVVS is a duo of accidental best friends. Amber Renee and Graham Marsh might never have met if not for a last minute text invitation to a stranger’s house party. Soon they were writing the songs that would become their first CLAVVS releases. Two albums later, Amber and Graham have dialed in their sound, one that merges his obsession with world music sounds and hip hop drums with her imaginative lyrics and off-kilter pop melodies. The result is both familiar and otherworldly, a distinctive sound that has earned the duo praise from Consequence of Sound, Earmilk, and The 405, who calls CLAVVS “indie hitmakers.”
Despite their often dark and hypnotic sound, there is something hopeful and human in their music. Amber and Graham are energetic and emotive, unafraid to move to their own rhythms. Perhaps that makes sense, as Amber grew up performing in musical theater and singing original Americana songs while Graham spent years on the major label side, earning 4 Grammys before walking away to find a place in the industry that felt more human. CLAVVS is just that— an alternative pop band that examines human experiences with candor and imagination.

While on tour, Collin witnessed firsthand the power that a well-crafted song could have on an enthusiastic, packed house. He discovered that it’s all about creating something visceral; something more felt than heard – that it's all about the song.

Soon in 2011, they earned a loyal following as a garage band with the songs such as ""Tagtaa"" (Pigeon) and ""Malchik"" (Boy?), and made the first appearance at the renowned Playtime Festival.

While true to producing the sophisticated, ‘colorful’, and up-to-date sound, it has sought and will seek to create the unique songs and music.

325,Combo Chimbita,"Through her folkloric mystique, otherworldly psychedelia, and a dash of enigmatic punk, Ahomale by Combo Chimbita catapults the sacred knowledge of our forebears into the future. Their second studio album and Anti- Records debut sees the visionary quartet drawing from ancestral mythologies and musical enlightenment to unearth the awareness of Ahomale, the album’s cosmic muse. Comprised of Carolina Oliveros’ mesmeric contralto, illuminating storytelling and fierce guacharaca rhythms, Prince of Queens’ hypnotic synth stabs and grooving bass lines, Niño Lento’s imaginative guitar licks, and Dilemastronauta’s powerful drumming, the lure and lore of Combo Chimbita comes into existence.  
The legend begins with their first EP, 2016’s El Corredor del Jaguar, and followed up with the occult psychedelia of Abya Yala. In 2019’s Ahomale, the New York-by-way-of-Colombia troupe fuse the perennial rhythms of the Afro-Latinx diaspora with a modern-day consciousness, while tracing the prophetic traditions of our ancestry. “The more we’ve played music together, the more we began to discover things within ourselves that we were previously unaware of, almost like a energy.

332,Control Top,"Covert contracts rule our world: manipulative relationships, encoded social norms, opaque technologies. “With a covert contract, the trick is that the agreement is only known by the person who makes it,” says Ali Carter, vocalist/bassist of Philly post-punk trio Control Top. On their debut full-length Covert Contracts, out April 5th on Get Better Records, Carter with guitarist/producer Al Creedon and drummer Alex Lichtenauer rip open space for catharsis. Their explosive songs, co-written by Carter and Creedon, blend no-wave inspired dissonance and the melodic beauty of pop, delivered with the immediacy of punk. At once anthemic and chilling, Covert Contracts puts words to today’s unspoken anxieties. Brimming with post-punk poetry for 2019, it’s the sound of agency being reclaimed. Following SXSW, Control Top join Laura Jane Grace & the Devouring Mothers and Mercy Union for a six-week tour of the US and Canada.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Label, Management, Brand Partnership, Gear Endorsement, Distribution - US, Distribution - UK/Europe, Distribution - Worldwide, Other Artists to Tour With, Booking Agent - US, Booking Agent - UK/Europe, Booking Agent - Worldwide, PR/Publicity Agency, Producer/Studio Engineer, Publishing, Sync/Music Supervisors",Punk,Post-Punk,"Philadelphia, PA","Mar 14, 2019",1:30pm-2:00pm,Mohawk Indoor,False
333,Cory Kendrix,"“In the three years between Kendrix’s last release and Me Right Now, the singer uprooted himself to Colorado, physically leaving behind the already geographically fractured LNS Crew for new opportunities and some semblance of maturity. Kendrix explains in Me Right Now’s liner notes that the work is “an open window into my life” the product of a stressful move and the struggles of dealing with “the insecurities of a relationship and fatherhood, of following my dreams while juggling real life.” The EP’s predecessor Worth Something hinted at those insecurities as well, and paved the way for Kendrix to abandon hip hop braggadocio for self-loathing R&B but Me Right Now and Kendrix’s rebranding make it something more permanent and evocative.
Kendrix makes this change apparent not just in the more melodic vocal approach but in the claustrophobic emotional intensity of every facet of the production, from the raw, blunt lyrics to the hurt and wounded feeling of the music itself. The aptly named “Pain” hits with the density of a throbbing toothache, Kendrix’s voice quavering over seismic bass and gasping samples.” - Nick Hanover (Ovrld)

But in the words of Leonard Cohen, ""There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in.” 
Greg battled the long upward road of rehab and it was basic traits such as strengthening his hand mobility that lead to strumming again on an old electric guitar. Realizing he was finally making progress both physically and musically; writing bouncy 80s melodies and fluid 60s vocal lines that really encouraged his desire to make recovery his number one priority.  
Two years on, in 2017, approx. one month into walking again, Greg and Cosmico took to the stage and played their first show at Stubb's in Austin, TX.  Local Grammy Nominated music producer Chris ""Frenchie"" Smith was in the audience and he heard something special in this indie rock outfit. Frenchie took the band under his wing and made it his mission to help mold the sound and record the band at his studio, The Bubble.

339,Coven,"When Relapse reissued the Pentagram back catalog, many people believed that American doom's patient zero had finally been given its due. But dig deeper, and you'll find an even more mysterious nugget with an origin story that seems to defy history. On the sunset eve of the sixties, as flower power was wilting and the winds of change blew a cold breeze over Altamont, a Midwestern rock group called Coven struck the first chords of major label satanic rock. But the story is even stranger than that...
Coven's debut album from 1969 kicks off with a song called ""Black Sabbath."" The bass player's name on that record was Oz Osborne. These coincidences are almost inexplicable, especially considering the UK album debut from the Sabbath we all know wasn't released until February 1970.
The second side of Coven's debut LP, Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls, features a full ritual. This is ground zero for occult rock, and many have followed its bloody footprints in the snow... 
Coven was the artistic outlet and brainchild of Jinx Dawson. She was well known for her dead serious satanic beliefs, her succubus beauty, and her thrilling voice. In 2019, it's de rigeur to play occult-influence

The influences range from noise rock icons like Gun Club and Grant Hart to modern garage rock acts Viva L'American Death Ray Music, Reigning Sound, The Golden Boys and back to mid-60s groove and R&B like The Grassroots, T.K. Hulin, Johnny Rivers, and Tommy James. Fake Eyelashes is the band's first new album since 2007's Beauty School (Emperor Jones, reissued in 2017 on Super Secret Records), and it will be released on Austin's Super Secret Records. It picks up right where the band left off, carrying the torch for great, under the radar rock 'n' soul.

352,The Curls,"The Curls claim to hail from Chicago but seem to mentally reside in outer space or perhaps Hollyweird. The general consensus is that these people are total nutballs and must be ""on something"" to come up with this stuff. 
Led by enigmatic and universally respected band leader Mick Fansler, the sextet blends genres like these health nuts blend smoothies. Their music has been labeled as Psych Pop, Art Rock, Nu-Angular Guitar, Real Chicago Blues and even Hardcore Experimental Adult Contemporary. The Harvard Crimson reported, ""The Curls are a fun, nostalgic sextet whose genre fluidity necessitates a string of hyphenated descriptors—art-funk-jazz-psycho-punk-pop-rock doesn’t even cover all the bases."" 
An impressive and widely regarded performance at Pitchfork Music Festival 2018 has led to a growing and unstable fanbase. The Curls have shared stages with popular music greats like Tame Impala, Courtney Barnett, Maps and Atlases, Post Animal and Texas Fred. The group's 2017 record SUPER UNIT received approval from legendary guitar rocker Adrian Belew (King Crimson, Talking Heads). Belew raved typing in all caps via Facebook Messenger, ""I LIKE IT!""

355,Curse Of Lono,"Curse Of Lono released their second album ‘As I Fell’ in August 2018. Produced by Oli Bayston (Boxed In) at Rancho V in Joshua Tree, California and Flesh & Bone in London, ‘As I Fell’, entered the Official Americana Albums Charts at No. 10 and the Official Independent Albums Breakers Chart at No. 15 in the UK. 
‘As I Fell’ builds on the band’s deeply cinematic blend of harmony-laden Americana and driving, gothic alt-rock. It’s a sound that owes as much to old faithfuls like The Doors and The Velvet Underground as it does to more modern practitioners of the form such as The War On Drugs and Wilco. 
The album has been accompanied by a short documentary 'Somewhere In Their Heads' which has won Best Short Documentary at the LA Edge Film Awards and the Changing Face International Film Festival in Sydney.
Curse Of Lono, who formed in London in 2015, are Felix Bechtolsheimer (vocals, guitar), Joe Hazell (lead guitar and vocals), Dani Ruiz Hernandez (keys and vocals), Charis Anderson (bass and vocals) and Neil Findlay (drums).
Curse Of Lono received the prestigious Bob Harris Emerging Artist Award at the UK Americana Awards in January.

361,Da Chick,"It’s easy to stumble on the idea that listening to Da Chick is like travelling back in time: maybe to that New York era where Disco and Punk, New Wave and Hip-Hop would cross styles and shake the dance floors. Nothing wrong with that idea: there’s a lot of that classic Boogie spirit, with a strong passion and straightforwardness, a sassy attitude and a groove drinking from the best sources. 
But if it’s true that listening to Da Chick is like travelling back in time, we should also think about the future as a mark for what this artist presents us: it’s a future where female creativity and freedom are not questionable at all and where this electronic dance, made in Portugal, still has a lot to give and inspire worldwide.
Da Chick carries her name and image: new releases, but also design, styling, videos...  And on stage, alone or escorted by a full band, Da Chick makes sure you get the message on who’s the funk machine: her powerful and lightning live shows granted her a win for Best Live Performance Award in Portugal, to be invited by Peaches to sing on her show, and to open for massive Funk legends like Earth Wind and Fire and Maceo Parker.

367,Danger Grove,"One day in the Enchanted Wood, in a dark and humid grove, there was a stirring and a little animal called Lizard brought a beat she had made to a large, cynical, tenuously notorious animal called rap legend Jesse Dangerously from the Backburner Crew.
rap legend Jesse Dangerously roared their appreciation – that tastes pretty good! Is there more! – and Lizard said yes I have got more. I’ll make more. There is more.
A wise old owl said they were influenced by Aesop Rock and Ramshackle Glory, and that the album they made together sounds like “if Drake listened to Neutral Milk Hotel.” It’s true they paid the owl to say this, but that doesn’t mean he was lying. Money words can be true ideas. He even said they could “chance the shape of Canadian hip-hop to come” but gosh, who knows?

368,Daniel Brandt,"Daniel Brandt, co-founder of acclaimed German ensemble Brandt Brauer Frick, released his second solo album Channels with Erased Tapes in October 2019.
The seven-track LP is Brandt’s biggest statement yet, with the album’s thrilling avant-garde framework interweaving chord-driven techno, orchestral flourishes, rich electronic textures and hints of dark cinematic pop. Following on from 2017's Eternal Something, which captured a contemplative kind of isolationism, with Channels Brandt set out to create an album that captures the essence of minimalism whilst lending it to a more playful context. 
After performing and recording Steve Reich’s Six Pianos in a group of six, Brandt began regularly composing long meditations on the piano, something that permeates the sound of the new record. Its frenetic energy and shape-shifting identity was also born out of touring with his new band Eternal Something — comprised of Brandt on piano, drums and synthesisers, Pascal Bideau on guitar and bass, plus Florian Juncker on trombone — and a desire to translate both the sound and spiritual unity of their live shows in which musicians locked together to create an intriguing meld of expansive works.

369,Daniel Francis Doyle and the Dreams,"The Dreams are an Austin TX group that has been performing since 2013. The band includes Daniel Francis Doyle (also of Deep Time); Luis Martinez (Horse Plus Donkey, Deep Time); and Nemir Naayem (Basic). Their new EP, “Unrecognizable,” is a cassette release available on Austin’s Self Sabotage Records. The EP’s peculiar romantic ballads were recorded and mixed in Austin at BUG SOUND with producer Paul D Millar (SLUGBUG, Ariel Pink, Gary Wilson). The group recorded the “Unrecognizable” EP live in one day with some of the vocals being recorded live as well. The songs were usually rhythm-based before being fleshed out and written as a band. The result is seven strikingly original songs, an emotive blend of post-punk & power pop at once jubilant and pensive. The first single, “I Had To Do It,” is also the first track; like much of the EP, it features a relentless pulse provided by Martinez’s electronic drum kit and Naayem’s synthesized bass. Doyle’s throwback guitar parts and overwhelmed vocals don’t attempt to blend in so much as stand out. Much of the Dreams’ strength lies in their pulling in three wonderfully chaotic directions,

And obviously, we also draw a lot of influence from the Beatles.” He laughs. “Well, I say ‘obviously’ from my point of view, but we'll see how other people feel about that.”

Danni’s biggest influence was their grandfather who also taught them how to record their vocals to tape. Danni, then, became the tape bandit! Stealing every tape they could get their hands on to record songs they’d written or practice harmonies. Cassettes are indicative of how they learned music and how they live life holding onto the things that shape us for the good.

376,Darkbird,"I wanted to be here
I wanted to behave
But it's so hard tonight
Lyrics to the first song Kelly and Brian would ever write together set the stage for the romantic waterloo that would become Darkbird. 
Kelly Barnes left Los Angeles after a broken marriage resulted in a broken band. Just prior to the move, she unexpectedly hit international success, singing a monster hit called, “Get Shaky” with DJ Ian Carey. While the track and a few others were financially significant to the ex-wife and waitress, the style of music was unfulfilling to Barnes. She began to dread performing the songs and eventually became fearfully depressed.
After a tragic house fire in NYC, Brian Cole opted for a fresh start. As his belongings smoldered in the winter snow, he decided to pack up what was left and head south in search of warmer days and better luck.
Ironically, while most go to LA or NYC to make their dreams come true, Brian and Kelly found each other on the musician page on Craigslist in Austin, TX. While they had hoped to leave their pasts behind, inevitably, the heartbreaks found a place they call home in Darkbird.

In 2018 they released their third album “While I Was Asleep” worldwide on Jansen Records, and one could hear a slightly different and revitalized Darling West. Relentless touring and playing big festival stages has served as a catalyst to give them more edge and confidence. While continuing to play their sweet Americana/Cosmic Folk, the music has more drive and the melodies are catchier than before. 
The album received great reviews from Uncut Magazine, Greil Marcus in The Village Voice, Classic Rock Magazine, Americana UK, Folk Radio UK, Belwood Music, Americana Highways and many more. As No Depression put it: “They are a perfect example of how Americana has infected the rest of the world, and they play it with great affection.”

380,Das Body,"Out of the greyer climes of Oslo— particularly East Oslo with its drizzly expanse of apartment blocks and gas stations stocked with Kent cigs and smut mags— has suddenly come a burst of color by the name of Das Body. Ellie, Kim, Patrik, Didrik— all four were born and bred in Norway and have become fast friends making music that is listenably and undeniably pop, though just a little iffier— pop that feels like a newly-thrifted favorite T-shirt: comfortably worn, slightly sunfaded, and with a cigarette burn on its sleeve. Das Body is writing pop music without the sentimentality that oversweetens so much currently on radio rotation. Instead, to their vulnerability, they mix in a little vulgarity, or a little light-heartedness. After a few years deep in the studio, they have now emerged with already plenty of buzz from local fests and press, and their debut EP released in September 2018 on Luminelle Recordings. Das Body brings a uniquely Nordic odd-pop that is, nonetheless, destined for charts the world over.

381,David Boring,"Formed in 2013, Hong Kong, David Boring is named after the unlikely hero from American cult classic graphic novel David Boring. Musical influences of the band include punk, post-punk, noise, no-wave and industrial. Signatured with their dirty, experimental noise, male-female interlacing spoken dialogues and the occasionally violent live performances, DB explores the murky modernity with a ferocious postmodern skepticism, creating a dark, borderline claustrophobic world that either excites or traumatizes. 
Since the release of the album in 2017, DB went from being an under-the-radar local cult favourite, to slowly reaching out to a more international audience. They were named by i-D, as well as Dazed and Confused magazine, as one of the top 5 bands from East Asia to watch out for. Fueled by a unique blend of unflinching ferocity and poetic eloquence, the band was also featured in the late Anthony Bourdain’s last episode of Parts Unknown, where they were introduced to an American audience.
DB is Laujan (vocal), Jason (guitar), Stan (drums) and Yat-Wa (guitar).

The band started as Jason Simon on vocals and guitar, Steve Kille on bass, and Mark Laughlin on drums. They began to combine 70s heavy metal and 60s psychedelic rock with themes from authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft. The first album, Dead Meadow, was released in 2000 on Tolotta Records, a label run by Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. The LP version was released by Planaria Records. This was quickly followed by 2001's Howls from the Hills, also released on Tolotta Records.

Her sound mixes the classic country sounds of Reba, McBride and the smoky voice of Stevie Nicks with a modern country/pop freshness that energizes the senses in today's crazy lightning-paced world. Her brash lyrics come straight from her sleeve, weaving stories of heartache, hard-living & hopeless romanticism. She was paralyzed now on the mend she's at it again! 
There is no missing this sonic sultress when she crosses your path. Lord knows she fought like hell to get here so damnit you better pay attention. 
Take a seat, it’s showtime.

392,Dear Boy,"Dear Boy had an immense 2018. They were hailed as one of the best bands in LA by critics and music publications, sold out multiple hometown shows, embarked on a full US tour w/ Rogue Wave, while also playing dates w/ Day Wave and Sunflower Bean. They're starting 2019 running full blast with ""Semester,"" the first new single from The Strawberry EP, released on 3/1 via the band's own label Easy Hell and Burnside/The Orchard. The song, is best described by vocalist and guitarist Ben Grey; ""Most of us have whole periods of our lives that are defined by one person… And when that person leaves, returning to your normal life feels strange. Almost as if the world moved on behind your back.""
The band has inspired the respect of fellow artists, so it should come as no surprise that The Strawberry EP features appearances by their friends Day Wave, Hazel English and Patrick Spurgeon of Rogue Wave. Produced by Dear Boy, and mixed by Tony Hoffer (AIR, Phoenix, Beck, M83), the EP once showcases their ability to craft bittersweet songs pulling from late 70's / early 80's Post-Punk and early 90's Britpop, large enough for arenas, but intimate enough to be with you during your most private moments.

394,DEATHCHANT,"
DEATHCHANT is the brainchild of TJ Lemieux (CHILD, Psychedelic speed freaks, Mainline ladies, Babylon) formed in 2018 in Los Angeles, CA. They have been dubbed Psychedelic rock, proto-metal, doom, stoner metal, noise-punk, hard rock, and everything in between, but if you ask them it's ""rock and roll with psychedelic influences."" Their imagery and sound seem to fluctuate rapidly between a peaceful meditative eastern-tinged message of unity and all out warcry with an underlying message of love and peace-through-violence. 
Driven by Thomas (TJ) Lemieux’s brooding aesthetic and signature psychedelic guitar character, DEATHCHANT echoes through the darker side of Proto-metal and hard rock. Reflections of past endeavors from TJ Lemieux, John Bolino, Colin Fahrner, and George Camacho (Roast, psychedelic speed freaks, high rise, Babylon) cascade into an immersive wall of noise-induced heavy metal mania, equal parts paranoia and transcendental harmony. These four create a sound that is loud, massive, and about as melodic as a sonic assault of this magnitude can be.  They resonate with wherever or whoever you are and deliver an excitingly raw and catchy brand of rock and roll.

398,Deeper,"Deeper’s Origins date back to 2014 when prior to releasing any material an abrupt line-up change left the Chicago based band looking for a new direction. Singer and guitarist Nic Gohl along with childhood friend, guitarist Mike Clawson and drummer Shiraz Bhatti threw out all of their old songs and brought on bassist Drew McBride to round out the lineup. The subsequent demos leaned on intricate guitar interplay, direct “of the times” vocals and a spirit that speaks to the band’s collective place in this pit of endless internet.
Deeper honed their sound over the course of 2015 and 16’ in basements, lofts, and anywhere that would have them. Touring the demos and landing at a fully realized inflection point. Call it Post-Punk, call it Indie Rock, it’s a record that steps in and out of boxes filtered through an unmistakable midwestern lens.

401,Deezie Brown,"Based out of Austin, Texas, Deezie Brown delivers a very edgy, dark, and rebellious depiction of Alternative Hip-Hop and Electronic Pop. Deezie Brown was exposed to hip-hop at an early age while he rode around with his dad listening to some of the great artists of the South such as OutKast and UGK.
His debut album, Judith, was released on February 26th, 2018. The album, which is named after Judith from The Bible, was a woman who fought her town as it was besieged by enemies and death imminent. She murdered the enemy general, Holofernes and hung his severed head on the city walls. 
The album is a reflection of this story. Deezie found his creative mind, heart and soul being challenged by various ‘enemies’. The album is the beheading of these enemies. A triumphant body of work. Judith stands as the beheaded enemies as Deezie is currently working on his sophomore project.
The album was received well among the underground landing him interviews on the ‘Kayne Podcast’, ‘The Most Unruly’ and continuous spins on KUTX 98.9. He played at the notable SXSW Festival, The Underground Music Showcase and Austin’s Inaugural Summer Jam.

415,Devon Church,"It can take years to find your voice. In the case of the Winnipeg-born, Brooklyn-based musician Devon Church, it took the dissolution of a decade-long marriage and creative collaboration (Exitmusic, a nightmare-pop project co-founded by Church's ex-wife) to send him down the road of discovering his own singular, rough-hewn-yet-elegant style. 
Church applies his experience as a producer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter to an equally absorbing solo project—one that plunges his Cohen-esque pop poetics into an ocean of drone, psychedelic minimalism, harmonic noise, and distortion-tinged, angelic ambience. Sensuous, surrealist lyrics—touching on themes of romantic obsession, religious ambivalence, dysfunctional families, and the ineffable strangeness of human existence—are delivered in a ravaged, soulful baritone, approximating some chimeric offspring of two-cigarettes-at-once Tom Waits, a tripped-out David Bowie, and John Maus.  The result is a well-crafted exploration of samsara and nirvana, heaven and earth, two states seemingly coexisting in the songs themselves. It's an entrancing listen.

425,The Dirty Nil,"Sure, playing 350 shows over the past three years all over the world was pretty impressive, but The Dirty Nil didn’t just spend the past few years on the road in support of their debut album, Higher Power. They spent much of it opening for—and, more importantly, studying—the greats: Against Me!, Billy Talent, Alexisonfire. They’re bands who, like the Nil, cut their teeth for years on the local circuit, but now find themselves playing arenas and headlining festivals. With Master Volume, The Dirty Nil are ready to make the same leap—not by polishing their sound for radio, but by bulking it up to fill the stadiums and open fields of their most vivid rock ‘n’ roll fantasies. 
Produced by John Goodmanson, Master Volume is an album that crunches and grooves where the band once smashed and trashed, unleashing the Nil’s undiminished raw power in more controlled waves to better target the back rows. “It’s less of a sprint and more of a strut,” singer Luke Bentham says. Loaded with steady-grooving songs about living fast and life-affirming anthems about dying young, Master Volume ultimately amplifies The Dirty Nil’s most essential quality: their refusal to be defined.

427,Divino Niño,"Listening to Divino Niño feels like catching up with an old friend. There’s undeniable songwriting chemistry between guitarist Camilo Medina and bassist Javier Forero, who met as kids in Bogotá, Colombia and years later reconnected by sheer happenstance after their families had both moved to Miami. Now Chicagoans, their rhythmic, soulful --and at times bilingual --Latinx punk songs are a reflection of their continent-spanning bond and proof that Divino Niño couldn’t have formed without unlikely but happy coincidences.
After cutting their teeth in southern Florida bands, Forero and Medina decamped to Chicago in 2010 to study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. There they met guitarist Guillermo Rodriguez and together, the three became roommates in 2013 and started recording the earliest Divino Niño demos. Drummer Pierce Codina caught wind of these demos and joined shortly after.
Divino Niño's new single ""Foam"" was released January 29th via Winspear. The band's new LP will follow in the summer of 2019.

Their vocal range is elastic, floating from an elegant purr into an unvarnished, guttural growl, and then back again at a moment’s notice. Their writing can be dreamy, but more often plumbs the soul, pricking deep with a poet’s precision and showing the scars that remain. To listen to Dua Saleh is to hear, in real time, someone fight for the right to define themselves for themselves.

Dwagie’s status in Asia is legendary: from being a founding member of the first rap group to secure a record deal to the success of his current album which has garnered him multiple awards. In addition to being a staple in the local hip hop media, he has also received much attention from international outlets, including  interviews with TIME Magazine, CNN, BBC, Reuters, The Times (UK), Al Jazeera, and multiple appearances on Discovery channel. Internationally, Dwagie has performed in the South by Southwest (SxSW) Festival, CMJ in New York City, and toured in not only North America, but also in London, and the Eurosonic Noorderslag Festivals in Netherlands. Dwagie has attracted various media coverages, from Hype Magazine, Hip Hop Dx, to MTV Iggy. In a closing summary of a feature article  wrote “There are MCs abroad that are closer to the hip-hop ideal than most American rappers. Dwagie is one of the brightest examples. American hip-hop can learn a lot from Dwagie — if it takes the time to listen.”
In 2014, Dwagie collaborated with DJ Premier and Nas and released 2 tracks “Classic” and “Refuse to Listen,” respectively.

On the threshold of what, you may understandably inquire? World domination, the apocalypse, a slushy mission to the local 7-Eleven?
The answer may well be “all of the above,” but we think none is as important as the impending release of the Salt Lake City group’s hotly anticipated second full-length, Pagan Fruit (call us biased!), which is due to see the light of day through Small Stone Recordings in May of 2014.
The album follows in the still echoing sonic shockwaves of Dwellers’ enthusiastically received debut of 2012, Good Morning Harakiri, which saw the newly assembled trio of vocalist/guitarist Joey Toscano, bassist Dave Jones, and drummer Zach Hatsis pooling together their impressive prior musical credentials (Toscano with psych-metal adventurers Iota; Jones and Hatsis with doom/goth atmospheric bandits, SubRosa) with staggeringly powerful and memorable results.
Now, the terrible triplets are confident they can one-up themselves with Pagan Fruit: an album that both exceeds the lysergic power chord trip initiated on that first album, and expands the band’s creative horizons into realms heretofore unexplored.

Now, the group returns with Rocket (2018, Verve Forecast), their first new music in a dozen years—and as the title indicates, they remain a propulsive and unclassifiable force, a whirlwind of musical ideas and styles.
The band members, of course, have all continued to create music and collaborate on other projects, but never lost touch. Every few years, Brickell would reconnect with guitarist Kenny Withrow, drummer Brandon Aly, bass player Brad Houser, and percussionist John Bush and they would improvise new songs. In 2017, when the band reunited for three sold-out benefit shows for La Rondalla arts school, their improvisational drive led to an album’s worth of new songs. Rocket bounces effortlessly between genres, from the disco strut of “Exaggerate” to the shimmering and propulsive “Superhero,” to the reggae lope of “Singing in the Shower.”

Textures matter as much as melodies. Genres bend and blend. Electronics rub shoulders with odd instruments. Katy Sargent sings as though casting a spell.
The Omnitone Collection, Elder Island’s extraordinary debut album, boasts ten tracks that are rich tapestries of tiny moments in time, but also sweeping soundtracks riven with ambition. They are songs to lose yourself in, to be swept away by, to send shivers up your spine.
Formed six years ago as an experiment-come-university hobby, Elder Island are singer and cellist Katy, bassist and beats maker Luke Thornton and guitarist and synth wizard David Havard. None hail from Bristol, but the city was what brought them together and its genre-mashing scene was what inspired them to start Elder Island.
The trio of Four Tet fans started out with jam sessions at home, adding weird percussion to Luke’s loops and stitching field recordings in to their soundscapey songs.

Born to Sudanese and Scottish parents and raised across seven countries, she is the descendent of a long line of progressive artists and academics dating back to the 1800s. She holds an MPhil in Philosophy, speaks four languages and is a graduate in Jazz from the Guildhall School. She is a complex character, impossible to pigeon-hole as she constantly redefines herself.
Key to the respect the industry shows for Eliza’s work is the fact that she manages to be both a serious grafter and a true fighter for that which she believes in. Her debut album Future is a body of work she has fought tooth and nail to complete. Set on the bedrock of Eliza’s early folk and grunge influences, it revels in “flavours of trip-hop, West-Coast surf sounds, 80’s chorus, 90’s movie soundtracks, and all-out pop” while still managing to sound like a focused, devastatingly precise and cohesive body of work.
Eliza has toured across the UK and Europe and is looking forward to playing her first shows in the US at SXSW.

No stranger to the music industry, Murcia cut his teeth as a songwriter-producer penning songs for a diverse list of mainstream artists including Celine Dion and Pitbull. With El Mañana, Murcia moves away from crafting mainstream pop to create an authentic sound channeling his diverse musical sensibilities through layered guitar textures reminiscent of seminal British shoegaze bands like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive, while still stepping very much forward into modern psychedelia a la Tame Impala. The songs feel dreamy & evocative with hints of melancholy while still highly melodic, colorful and full of light. Lyrically, Murcia’s songs reflect the duality of being bicultural— he writes in Spanglish juxtaposing the magical realism of his ancestral land in Colombia with the feel of the California magic hour he inhabits.

It's wild yet controlled, contemplative yet loud and elegantly messed up. In 2018 she released the self-produced singles ”Soul Traveller” and ”Into the Blue” and supported bands like Sunflower Bean and L.A. Witch on stage. Warm and piercing vocals float above a sound inspired by country and rock, fuzzy desert sounds and analog synthesizers with a minimalistic touch. Her 6 track EP ”We Gotta Talk” was released in spring 2017, produced by Victor Van Vugt (Nick Cave, PJ Harvey). ""Unfurling with a gentle jangle, the crisp, spring-fresh songwriting can't fail to get under your skin” wrote Clash Magazine.

They’re a band that writes songs like communing with nature, bringing all their fuzzed and tripped out idiosyncrasies into harmony. Empath began in 2016 when Garrett Koloski, Jem Shanahan, and Catherine Elicson moved into a house in West Philadelphia together, with Randall Coon joining shortly after. Even with the simple vision to shred, there’s a natural sensitivity in the way Empath communicates. Between the contrast of Elicson’s lush, almost delicate vocals, Koloski’s boisterous drumming, and the half-harmonious wash of guitar and Shanahan and Coon’s synths, Empath equips us with a healthy dose of emotional repose.""

Both lyrically and sonically, she strikes a fiercely independent chord, proudly releasing a deeply personal record that reflects her own upbringing in Tennessee, including the prejudices and injustices that she witnessed as a child that continue to impact her life to this day. According to Rae, ""this album was born out of a need to do some healing work in my personal life, in order to address some fears and patterns of mine to allow my true feelings to come to the surface."" 
Recorded in the dead of winter in an old Franciscan monastery on Wisconsin’s Fox River, the isolated environment created the perfect setting for Rae and her bandmates to track these genre-busting songs, using the chapel and other unique spaces within the cavernous building to explore new sonic boundaries, all while continuing to showcase the hypnotic vocals and song-serving restraint that have become her trademark.

Their live show is one of dynamic union; the strength of their partnership shines in performances that are commanding yet sensitive, soulful and pertinently groove-laced. Boiler Room rightly labelled the group as “pioneering the new-wave of U.K. jazz”. 
As the genre enjoys a new lease of life that is gaining momentum across the country, Ezra Collective are adding their own fresh and imaginative face to a style that continues to be “as entertaining as it is educational” (Trench). 2018 saw them sell out their full UK headline tour, bought continued success for their genre-bending second EP, Juan Pablo: The Philosopher and 2 acclaimed singles including ""Reason in Disguise"" feat.

Middle Tennessee, Faux Ferocious took their figure-it-out approach to freak out rock n’ roll and
hit the road to work with audio whiz Drew Vandenberg at the famed Chase Park Transduction in
Athens, GA. They ate together, smelled each other and broke down the ego achieving an
instinctive sound that allows expert musicianship and simple, evocative lyrics to work as one
highlighting the duality of space and constraint.
This record finds the sweet spot. It is angular and arresting, it is fast, it is repetitive, it is
kosmische, it is punk. It drones, it loops and swirls around. It is guitar rock for people who
wonder what it would be like if Ron Asheton and Michael Rother were also in Crazy Horse. The
songs on this album allow each musician to stand out without taking over. The lyrics are clear
and you can follow the thread of each instrument a

Several major label overtures have been entertained down the years, but ultimately Bettinson has always preferred to pursue her own artistic vision.
“I like my pop music a little bit weird,” she says. “I like it to challenge, to push the envelope a little bit — not just repeat what’s gone before.” This has been the case ever since those early performances, which earned Bettinson the attention of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who recruited her to front electronic alt-pop group Ultraísta. Following rave reviews from Pitchfork, The Guardian and Rolling Stone, Bettinson then took a sabbatical to launch her solo career as FEMME.

When Medosch says “my fingertips are glowing / but it's not enough to keep me from blowing up,” on “ “Please,” one might believe her. Named in honor of Chloe Sevigny’s character in the film Brown Bunny, Medosch’s songs are about cultivating a sense of self-acceptance in the face of social shame and bullying. Brown Bunny is full of startling nuance and diverse emotionality, from the sorrowful melancholy of “KFG” to the anticipatory excitement of “Kanagawa”. Brown Bunny is a fully realized portrait of tying the loose ends of adolescence and venturing onwards.

619,FOOLS,"""If you haven’t caught FOOLS’ live show yet, you’re missing out on one of the best parties in Austin... A thrilling collision of glam theatrics and punk brattiness.”   - Nick Hanover, OVRLD
Scotty May (Bass) grew up outside Detroit; Jacob Miguel (vocals) and Chris Goranson (guitar) outside Chicago. There's a grit, an authenticity, an anxious tension in the rock music from the rust belt. Take a group of guys who spent 30 years of 6-month winters cultivating their musical tastes and then drop them in Austin, TX, and you get FOOLS. Now joined forces with Zach Whitchurch (drums) Texas native. 
With one release to date - they have managed to open for significant local and touring acts such as Meat Wave, Dasher, Wildlife, Sweet Spirit, Think No Think, A.J. Davila, the MVP’s, Gym Shorts and Night Beats. These fire starters fill rooms quickly, bringing in onlookers from the street who are wondering, “Who the hell is that band?” A reputation for rowdy, energetic live shows has them lighting up faces of even the most out of place spectators.
FOOLS has undoubtedly left a mark on the underground scene in Austin, raising the stakes on how they are received by the rest of the world at SXSW 2019.

'Keen For a Can' doesn’t simply convey the desire to grip an ice cold aluminium cylinder in ones hand, which in itself is a thing of true beauty. To be 'Keen For a Can’ is to be ready for what is right in front of you, to put all the noise that steals your focus aside and dive into the moment happening right in front of you . To often we are focused on things that are happening far away from where we really are, bombarding our lives with unnecessary content that we were previously oblivious to.

638,Future Museums,"Founded in 2012, Neil Lord has an impressive catalog of wide ranging solo and collaborative albums under the moniker Future Museums. Lord recorded Rosewater Ceremony Part II by himself in 2017 immediately following Rosewater Ceremony using the same set of gear in his home studio. On this round of inner explorations and mental projections, Lord expands his emotional palette beyond the ubiquitous bliss of the first Rosewater Ceremony to include a dimension of empathetic consciousness. Gently pulsing percussion and bass sequences materialize into tastefully reserved rhythm sections, guiding Lord’s solemn guitar leads through the vast swells of atmospheric strings and shimmering trails of cosmic dust. Future Museums plunges deep into electronics for the Rosewater sessions, embracing drum machine, sampler and analog synthesizer as the primary voice. Future Museums has always forged a uniquely trance-inducing realm of sound manipulation out of a remarkable mix of intuition and technique, and now Lord has expanded his vocabulary both emotionally and tonally while continuing to preserve his essential center.

640,Gabriella Cohen,"In the summer of 2017, Gabriella Cohen moved to a farm in countryside Victoria, Australia, to record and self-produce her second album with engineer and partner-in-crime, Kate ‘Babyshakes’ Dillon. There, amidst flocks of screeching white cockatoos and herds of Black Angus cows, they etched the beginning of Pink Is The Colour Of Unconditional Love. Armed with a microphone and an interface, Dillon and Cohen captured the final touches of the album on a boat in England, and the coast of Portugal; in the mountains of Southern Italy, cafes of Mexico, and finally in Venice Beach, CA.
Pink Is The Colour has materialised as an expansive and exciting body of work, showcasing Cohen’s unusually refreshing twists on pop arrangements. Throughout the new album Cohen (flanked by a choir of imaginary dolls that exist in her head) creates complex and sugary backing vocals. These signature vocal arrangements—contoured with classic harmonies and nostalgic melodies—form songs remarkable in their originality. 
It’s an epitaph of electric wonder, and a definitive fact: Pink is the Colour of Unconditional Love.

It was also just the beginning of a grand adventure. With the wind of her award at their backs, Gaelynn and her husband Paul sold their house in Northern Minnesota, quit their jobs, bought a van, and hit the road.
Since then, Gaelynn has played over 425 shows in 43 states and seven countries, adding over 100,000 miles to their Ford Econoline’s odometer. Yet somehow between this perpetual blitz of performances, Gaelynn also managed to release her third full-length album in September 2018.
""Learning How To Stay"" is an 11-song collection that runs the gamut sonically from pensive and luscious to aggressive and intentioned, from folk to decidedly pop. Undoubtedly the connecting thread of this album is Gaelynn Lea herself. With her singular voice & deeply-affecting violin, she guides the listener through a journey that explores the contrasting nature of existence: dark and light, birth and death, anger and forgiveness, sorrow and joy.

647,Garcia Peoples,"Discovering the secret and perhaps even endangered language of riffs, Danny Arakaki and Tom Malach formed Garcia Peoples in Rutherford, New Jersey, and over the past year and change, they've hit launching speed, writing albums’ worth of material too fast to release.  While 2018's ""Cosmic Cash"" and the upcoming ""Natural Facts"" (out March 29th on Beyond Beyond is Beyond) are the perfect introduction to the band’s cosmic Americana, the tapers have started showing up for Garcia Peoples, too, keeping track of the ever evolving live song suites. 
Playing cleanly articulated lines that perhaps recall some of great guitar tandems of yore–Allman/Betts, Jansch/Renbourn– while “summoning the Dead for Pavement fans”, Garcia Peoples epitomize ‘post-jam’ in its proper arrival point; borrowing all the best of what’s preceded them without regarding boundaries, a bounce all their own, and a characteristically delightful lack of polish to keep things grounded. With Andy Cush (bass), Cesar Arakaki (drums), and keyboardist Pat Gubler (PG6, Wet Tuna), it's a happy wonder to watch Garcia Peoples plunge into the outer reaches of rock with infectious enthusiasm.

Toma spearheads the musical side, while Star largely writes the lyrics, filling them with stories of her life. The title itself encapsulates that polarity, as well as the idea of Star's constant coming-and-going, flying across the great big blue of one ocean or another each time.

660,Ghostly Kisses,"Ghostly Kisses is the dreamy music of singer and songwriter Margaux Sauvé. She began to play the violin at the age of 5 following in the footsteps of her family of musicians. Years later, she started to sing and met Dragos Chiriac (Men I Trust). Together, they brought into being Ghostly Kisses first songs. The name 'Ghostly Kisses' was inspired from reading William Faulkner’s poem 'Une ballade des dames perdues’, and seemed a beautiful reflection of Margaux's ethereal voice. 
After releasing ""What You See - EP"" in 2017, her song 'Such Words' reached more than 50K listenings on Spotify 24 hours after its release and her song 'Roses' was chosen as the generic of cinematic film 'Ailleurs' in 2017. She also opened for international renowned artists such as RY X, Charlotte Cardin and Trixie Whitley in Canada and US.
With more than 7M plays on Spotify, she released 'The City Holds My Heart - EP' in 2018, a 5 pieces album inspired by the sonic textures of the 90's. Unfolding around Margaux’s soft voice, these songs progressively reveal different drums, synths, string arrangements and piano layers. Ghostly Kisses will release the sequel of this EP in 2019.

They combine aspects of fragile folk and delicate art rock to create ethereal chamber pop songs that are unafraid to wear their vulnerable hearts on their sleeve. The songs are shaped by Sid’s experiences, taking in his journey from birth in Portland, OR, to his childhood in both Australia and then New York, teenage years in Shanghai, China and a rambling road trip he took around the U.S.A. instead of finishing High School.
The group expands and contracts as the music and projects seem fit but contributing musicians include Bailey Blu (drums/piano/vocals), Sophie Cozine (vocals), Al Nardo (bass), Stan Simons (vocals) and Ruby Wang (violin).

In spirit and performance however the band more closely epitomizes bands like Butthole Surfers, The Black Lips, and Fat White Family with their mischievous, iconoclastic, and grotesquely charming energy.  Both clever and aggressive, the band thrash through would-be-pop songs, observing their surrounding from the depths.  In the past year they have supported acts such as The Black Lips, Dead Boys, Surfbort, Roky Erickson, Tropical Fuck Storm, Shannon & The Clams, Jacuzzi Boys, Bodega, Bambara etc.  Gnarcissists just released their self titled EP, a raw 4-track 7” on their own BLISS label, and are currently in the process of finishing their first LP.

678,Goldmyth,"“A classically trained harpist who makes dreamy synth-pop music? Yes please!” 
-Nylon Music
Based in the burgeoning music scene in Provo, UT (birthplace of Neon Trees, Imagine Dragons, and The Aces,) Goldmyth is a virtuosic singer-songwriter making irresistible electronic-pop music in an unusual way: the harp.  
Influenced by artists like Joni Mitchell, James Blake, and Sufjan Stevens, Goldmyth seamlessly blends glimmering harp chords with weighty synths and springy percussion. Yet, Goldmyth’s artistic voice might be best captured in her poignant, vulnerable lyrics and otherworldly vocals. She was heralded by Hilly Dilly as having “an earnest fragility in her lyrics and vocal delivery that seem beyond the years of an artist early in her career,” as well as “undisputed skill in crafting tight, concise indie-pop compositions.”
Goldmyth’s critically acclaimed debut EP, Faded Dream, released in 2017, was produced by Grammy nominee, Nate Pyfer (Kaskade, The Moth & The Flame) and Mason Porter (Haarlem, Polytype.) Line of Best Fit called her single, Has To Be Better, “a quietly brilliant synth-pop gem,” while Kick Kick Snare proclaimed, “All that glitters is not gold, but is Goldmyth.""

679,Gong Gong Gong,"工工工 (Gong Gong Gong) is the duo of Tom Ng and Joshua Frank. Formed in 2015 in Beijing, China, they make music from the sparest of means: one guitar and one bass, interweaving riffs and rhythms to create forward-charging, drummerless grooves. Their inspirations extend from Bo Diddley to African and Southeast Asian folk music, psychedelic drone, and the structures of electronic music. 
Together, the duo explore the concept of “phantom rhythm”—between their two instruments, an aura of ghostly snare hits emerges over a thumping low-end pulse. Atop this framework, Ng sings in his native Cantonese, recounting tales of absurdity and fragmented visions.
Active members of the Chinese music underground, Gong Gong Gong have nonetheless remained an anomaly—outsiders who call Beijing their home. After a series of self-released tapes recorded in underpass tunnels, subterranean art spaces, and on weathered 50-year-old guitars in a Hong Kong high-rise rehearsal studio, Gong Gong Gong released their first US single, Siren 追逐劇 on Brooklyn’s Wharf Cat Records in November 2018.

And they’ve had some great company doing it, playing along-side some of their good buddies such as Dune Rats, Violent Soho, DZ Deathrays and Skegss as well as 50+ headlining shows around the world. 
Taking some much needed downtime the Goochies spent the past summer relocating from LA, to their hometown of Newcastle to settle in for some songwriting and recording. The first tasty morsel is two-minute-forty-second feminist punk anthem (one for the ages!) 'Busy Bleeding', a poppy upbeat ode to “that time of the month”. 
When tossing up who they wanted to release the first of what is guaranteed to be many smash hit singles, The Gooch Palms couldn’t look past their old pals Dune Rats and Ratbag Records! Label deal done, Busy Bleeding was quickly followed by 'Marfa Lights' - Goochies ode to their favourite US art hub in the West Texas high desert, Marfa. So go take an earful of Busy Bleeding & Marfa Lights and get ready for 2019 to be officially known as “YEAR OF THE GOOCH”!!! More songs and many more shows to come!

682,Good Fuck,"Tim Kinsella and Jenny Pulse have consummated their love on disc. The result is Good Fuck, an erotic exploration of experimental literary techniques and adventurous electronic beats.
Seeking an intimate creative environment to develop their musical concepts, Kinsella and Pulse journeyed deep into isolation. “We packed the car and drove 13 hours to The Millay Colony in upstate New York: an artist’s colony in The Berkshires, miles down a private road, next to 100,000 acres of national forest,” Kinsella shares.
On arrival, the couple devised a unique artistic process to work from, Kinsella describes it as a “collaborative conscious alignment.” The most unique aspect of this creative method involves the writing of the album’s lyrics. “We agreed on 12 books we thought most relevant and came up with various systems to collapse and collage them into each other in different combinations,” Kinsella says. That list included titles ranging from Don Quixote to The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry. Drawing from this source material, Kinsella and Pulse employed a sort-of literary mash-up, scrambling content and structure into a thoroughly new product. “We might take the form of an Eskimo genesis

In 2018, Grace released two new EPs.  The first is an acoustic collection of songs written with longtime lead guitar player Calloway Ritch, entitled Blue Star in a Red Sky.  The second, produced by Michael Ramos and recorded at Firefly Studios in Fischer, Texas with an all-star backing band (JJ Johnson, David Grissom, Glenn Fukunaga & Michael Ramos) was the debut release of the new, critically acclaimed songwriting trio, Nobody's Girl (BettySoo, Rebecca Loebe, and Grace Pettis).  This EP, Waterline, was released by boutique record label Lucky Hound Music.
2019 finds Grace Pettis doing what she does best, making music.  She just signed a multi-year publishing deal in February of 2019 with BMG Music.

690,Graham Van Pelt,"“I’d like to be as un-mysterious as I possibly can,” Graham Van Pelt says. He’s about to release Time Travel, his first record in the four years since he moved from Montreal to Toronto, and he’s no longer Miracle Fortress, or Inside Touch, or any of the aliases he’s used to record over the years. He’s just Graham Van Pelt.
With the perspective of leaving a longtime home, of watching old friends change and familiar places become unrecognizable, came a recommitment to an emotional honesty in Van Pelt’s songwriting. Time Travel’s eight songs are a tangle of friendships and feelings. Moving backwards and forwards in time, they occupy a space of elegant melancholy.
Immersing himself in the work of house music legends like Larry Heard, Vincent Floyd and Maurizio and the fragile disco of Arthur Russell, along with contemporaries like Jessy Lanza and Kelly Lee Owens, Van Pelt built the album from the bottom up, rooting every track in the crude sequencer of the Roland SH-101 synth, a decades-old dance music totem. The result are melodies that are simple but affecting, anchored to deep, wandering basslines.

Songwriter Aleks Martray attributes his eclectic sound to a nomadic coming of age across three continents and a decade of touring, during which he met frontwoman Shari Bolar.

Their music attracts all types of ears, and is influenced by artists that go as hard as Nirvana, as gentle as Sufjan Stevens, and as dancy as Little Dragon.

694,Greenwave Beth,"One-half of well-loved Sydney band, Flowertruck, Greenwave Beth is the dark electro-pop duo of singer Charles Rushforth and drummer Will Blackburn. Their music captures what frontman Rushforth calls “a dance of agony”: that space where we move to the rhythm of our own anxieties and desires. The result is a delicate breed of electronic music – a sound with an angelic John Maus on one shoulder, and a demonic David Byrne on the other. Greenwave Beth released their debut EP “People In Agony” through Dinosaur City Records in 2018, combining the restrictive and industrial sounds of midi-sequenced drum and bass with free form songwriting. It’s a coming-of-age story that's unnerving and electrifying at the same time. Greenwave Beth are making their USA debut this March, supporting NZ indie royalty The Chills at sold-out shows in Portland and Seattle before settling into SXSW.

The band’s sound lies somewhere between that of X, The Fall, Sonic Youth and Fugazi, and more recent acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Surfbort and Downtown Boys.
Singer Amelia Bushell, guitarists Dan Peskin and Micah Weisberg, bassist Bill Dvorak and drummer Piyal Basu formed the band in late 2016. Since then, the group has been making a name for itself in the venues and DIY spaces of Brooklyn, with live shows quickly becoming known for the wild stage antics of Bushell.
Grim Streaker released its first single, ""Guts"" in January 2017, produced by Mike Kutchman (Parquet Courts, WALL, Bush Tetras). Stereogum called the track, ""one of those introductions that arrives fully formed while still promising even more to come.” 
CLRVYNT wrote that Bushell was “Courtney Love, Exene Cervenka and Kathleen Hanna all rolled into one, with an alto that cleaves her bandmates’ Adolescents-style tantrums in two.”
Their debut album will be released this Spring.

Grivo’s massive tones and effects are utilized as active compositional elements, brilliantly crafting and pacing their infectious riffs to allow the saturated guitars and bruising low-end to fully bloom. Born and raised in small-town Michigan, Grivo is led by guitarist/vocalist Timothy Heck who founded the band with his brother and drummer Matthew. The Heck brothers have shared a life-long musical partnership, starting as jazz-obsessed teenagers before diving into the punk and hardcore scenes of the Midwest in their early twenties. After years of intensive touring, they sought new inspiration and slower tempos, opting to relocate to Austin in 2015. Timothy adopted a reserved and accessible approach to songwriting, evoking empathy through minor key signatures while constructing intricate walls of auditory mass. Within the tidal sound waves and bleak timbre, Grivo forges a distinctive personal connection that challenges the modern definitions of doom metal and shoegaze

Despite it's bold title and seemingly warm connotations, upcoming single and first taster of their new material single Hot Summer was conceived on a very grey day in London. The pair tried to capture ""that feeling of despair when everyone around you is happy, but somehow you just don't feel it"" and produced by Richard X (Roisin Murphy, Goldfrapp, Kelis,) the result is no-nonsense anti-summer anthem. The Hot Summer festival tour included playing a bumper section of over 20 European festivals this year, including performances at Rock Am Ring, Melt, Fusion, Deichbrand, Lollapalooza Berlin and many more.

This four-piece punk dynamo from Rhode Island, is everything you want in a punk band: brutal, unrefined, and absolutely thrashing. With songs like, “Daylight Savings,” on which the band asserts, “I wish every day was daylight savings/an extra hour of sunlight/ an extra hour to get high,” they are exactly how you’d expect them to be offstage; upbeat, hilarious, New England punks who’d like nothing more than to goof off and make music with their friends. However that impression partially collapses when they mount the stage, strap into their instruments, and reveal their sludge-coated surf riffs and drums that sound both wildly anarchic and assertively tight. GYMSHORTS has been fiercely touring the U.S for the past few years supporting acts such as La Luz, Tacocat, Ron Gallo, The Frights, Death Valley Girls, Hunny and Naked Giants.

As a producer, Halima uniquely blends electronic music with bedroom Pop/RnB to create something both nostalgic and new.
Following in the footsteps of other female R&B singers, Halima has found her music as a way to process her relationships to others, but most importantly the vital relationship she has with herself. Halima’s latest single ""Do Better"" is an introspective ode to self-love with an upbeat hook that complements her soulful R&B voice; it’s a graduation from the artist’s slower last release, ""If Love was Green,"" that teased at the themes of this track. Condemning her previous self-destructive behavior, Halima decides it’s time to put herself, her needs and her desires before that of anyone else’s.

Released on January 8, 2016 via Holy Mountain Sounds, RIVAL gathers the most vulnerable details of their crossroads and recounts their experiences in a manner that provides an openness and honesty that most artists never approach.
Making an indelible mark on their hometown, Austin American-Statesman proclaimed, “Alternative-country has largely blended into the broader Americana landscape in recent years, but here’s a band that harkens back to the dead-center focus of the genre.” Not to be outdone, Austin Chronicle adds, “Harvest Thieves… comes from the Jackson Browne school of alt-country, where durable melodies and chunky guitars abound… demonstrating roots and smarts.”

His soul comes alive on the dancefloor. Ascribed as “emotional dance music,” Hazey Eyes calls upon the throbbing heartache of the early ‘00s alt-rock epoch while splicing it with shimmering indie and electronica aesthetics. He pulls on those strings once again for his new EP, Love Lost, an effervescent elixir of gluey hip-hop and mood-based pop-art. Only 22 years old, mastermind Thomas Michel has cultivated 63 million streams on Spotify, so, it’s no surprise he’s landed touring gigs with Shallou and Petit Biscuit.
The new project is Michel at his most vulnerable. Opener “Scars,” featuring Yoke Lore, sees him reveling in the past and its lasting imprint on his skin. “I will always fall hard” echoes one of his most candid lyrics, paired with a glittering, erratic beat to calm his nerves. “Hungover You,” alongside Moli, buzzes the fingertips but swerves more freely between somber lo-fi whispers and the feverish club-rave we’ve come to bask in. The Dresage-featuring “Living Wild” washes over the listener in cool drip-drops, while “Too Young” woos you into a vulnerable state.......................

Since moving to the Swedish capital at the age of twenty, he’s established himself as one of the key figures in the city’s indie rock underground; after starting out playing bass in the punk outfit Kilroy, he met the similarly prolific Martin Savage and joined his band, Martin Savage Gang, handling bass and backing vocals as the group toured across Europe and the United States. Working with Savage inspired Appel to step out front and centre himself, and in the summer of 2016, his new three-piece Lion’s Den released their self-titled debut album, one that had Appel on lead vocals and guitar and on which he penned the lyrics himself.
Lion’s Den continued in the Appel tradition of tightly-wound guitars and sharp melodies, with a quickfire running time and lyrics that reflected on the world around him. All the while, though, he was working on something that would mark a break away from the musical identity he’s spent over a decade cultivating. Burning Bodies is Appel’s first solo album, pieced together over the course of five years and consisting primarily of love songs that pertain

744,Hickeys,"Hickeys is a band from Madrid, Spain. Formed in 2017 by Marta SV, Ana Erice, Maite Barrena and Martina Gil. They have played many gigs in the capital and all along the country, supporting different local and international bands like Mujeres (Barcelona), The Parrots (Madrid) and Peach Pit (Canada), and also, they have played in the European DIY Music Conference. This year, they have played in festivals like FIB 2018, Sound Isidro 2018 Ebrovisión 2018 and Get Mad 2018. 
Their first EP is Diamond Munch, an unpredictable and contradictory mixture. Here is where feelings and thoughts of each member flowing across the creation process assemble with humanity on it, encouraging each one to shape this work. Distorted or wildly naked guitars, a set of voices that covers the entire vocal spectrum, basses with great presence and more rhythms than minutes of songs: an X-ray of the lives of its members during the creation process. Their peculiar style goes from lo-fi garage to 90s post-punk, what they finally have called Glitter-punk, coining this term as a personal brand.

746,High Waisted,"Quirky 60's garage rock is reimagined from the nose of a surfboard, making High Waisted feel like a psychedelic lullaby. NYC surf rockers with pop sensibilities, feminist ideals and an affliction for rock and roll. They’ve been called NME Magazine’s “Buzz Band to Watch,” “The Ultimate Party Band” by GQ and have received praise from Consequence of Sound, Noisey, and Paste. They released an interactive video in collaboration with Refinery29, performed sessions for Nylon Magazine, Paste Magazine, and Sofar Sounds.  The group spent 2016/17 touring, playing Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver as well as supporting such acts as Brazilian Girls, Shannon and the Clams, Kitten, Titus Andronicus, The Donkeys, Har Mar Superstar, Jessica Hernandez, La Sera, Diarrhea Planet, and La Luz. They released a track for NPR’s More Perfect, a split 7” which debuted on Billboard, followed by a music video premiere on UPROXX. Their unreleased sophomore record was produced by Tad Kubler (The Hold Steady) and mixed by Arun Bali (Saves The Day). Every show is a party when lo-fi fuzzy bass, reverb drenched guitars and radiant harmonies mesh to create the melodies of your wave-crashed daydreams.

747,HIJOS,"HIJOS is one of the experimental pop rock bands with the highest projection within the emerging music scene in Costa Rica. At present this group is comprised of Ali Mondol, on drums; Marvin Picado on the bass; Diego González on synths; and Pablo Rojas, as lead vocalist and guitarist.
The sound of HIJOS is a metaphor for San José as a city: embedded in the center of Costa Rica, halfway between South America and North America, between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, in the middle of everything; and taking influence from everyone. Thus, HIJOS vibrates with the sound of a city where the rhythm vibrates with a sophisticated subtlety between the trumpet, the jukebox, vinyl and the guitar.
The band’s first album, NU9VE, was dropped in 2016; several video clips and live sessions were released as part of their promotion. Recently, HIJOS was in charge of the soundtrack for the short El Gran Líbano, which was included in the film Lebanon Factory, which premiered at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival (2017).
On October 18, 2018, they launched their second full-length album, entitled Sol Naciente, considered one of the most outstanding Costa Rican releases of the year.

748,Hillsburn,"Hillsburn is a powerhouse. Their songs are timeless, their sound every bit as anthemic as Florence + The Machine’s, but with soaring three-part harmonies thrown in for good measure. The band has toured extensively across Canada, and in international markets like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. They released a deluxe version of their award-winning sophomore album, The Wilder Beyond, on February 1st, 2019.
Hillsburn’s indie-rock sound draws on the songwriting focus of folk music, and combines it with a pop sensibility. Their performances are dynamic, energized, and emotive. You won’t want to miss this band that is already on its way to becoming a national treasure.

From the “cocky, glossy blur of pure hedonistic glam"" (Rolling Stone) we heard with Casino to power-pop anthems like Whispers and Tra$h Can Luv, her debut album Forever or Whatever is one of the most hotly anticipated albums of 2019. 
Hailed as “a global pop sensation” (Paper Mag), Sidewinder is taking the world by storm with her captivating live show, including triumphant appearances at Pitchfork Avante Garde Festival in Paris and a star studded club show in NY (with no less than Bradley Cooper, Russell Crowe and Sienna Miller in attendance)! With her electrifying stage presence and contagious spirit, it’s no wonder she has been exalted as “a shining light in the darkness” (LA Record) and “a cut above everyone else in her realm” (Ion Mag). Fun Fact: Sia was her babysitter (for real).

751,Holly,"24-year-old music artist Miguel Oliveira, otherwise known as “Holly”, has quickly made quite a name for himself in the world of electronic music over the last 6 years. Holly was able to share his music around the world at an impressively early stage in his career, making stops in the US, Australia, Europe, Asia, and South Africa. During this time, he released his music on some of the largest independent music labels to date, including Buygore, Fool’s Gold Records, Dim Mak Records, and Monstercat. He quickly garnered the attention of many critically-acclaimed electronic producers– namely Rezz, Zeds Dead, Bloody Beetroots, Machinedrum, Bassnectar, Noisia, TOKiMONSTA, and more. Deemed ‘one of the top producers of 2017’ by both DJ Mag and Run The Trap, Holly clearly has had no trouble gaining recognition from both artists and fans alike. More recently, Holly has heavily geared his efforts toward producing innovative rap and hip-hop projects for numerous artists, such as ProfJam, Dengaz, Bloody Jay, Slow J, and Papillon. Holly’s engaging on-stage presence and innovative sound have catalyzed his emergence out of the SoundCloud scene and rapid growth in the electronic music scene.

Taking cues from artists like Suicide, The Shangri-Las and David Lynch, Holy Boy's arrangements are sparse yet atmospheric - Jæger's old soul contralto pushed through haunting vocal effects floats over primal drums and vintage organs. 
Her debut EP of ""explorations in consciousness"" was recorded at Ben Hillier’s (Depeche Mode, The Horrors, Blur++) Pool Studios in London and released to acclaim, with single “The Blood Moon” being premiered on BBC Radio 1 and Holy Boy performing at festivals including CMJ, NXNE and SXSW.

755,Honey and Salt,"For Honey and Salt, there is immense power in the parts of a whole. This idea has always been in the band’s DNA, from its three members -- each with their own distinct and essential contributions -- to the flurry of interlocking notes and melodies that make up their intricate songs. Now on their self-titled sophomore album, it also extends into their worldview, as Honey and Salt seek to cut through the pessimistic fog of seemingly inescapable sociopolitical unease, and highlight the vital capability of the individual. Where many bands look for commonality amongst its members’ tastes, Honey and Salt revel in their differences, seamlessly blending their disparate influences into a sound that manages to be complex without sacrificing immediacy. The self-titled album deftly utilizes everything from Kinsella-esque guitar lines, to post-rock dynamics, to hardcore ferocity — all while packing an emotional resonance straight out of DC’s Revolution Summer — and finds the band completely comfortable with balancing their intricacies.

757,Honyock,"Far from tilling barren ground, Honyock have claimed an out-of-the way territory to cultivate their own unique musical sensibility, laboring for friendship, brotherhood, honesty and the sheer joy of the process, far from any fame or treasure-seeking notions. If their profile is rising now, it’s at the best possible time. 
The result of a dream made manifest, El Castillo (out July 20th, 2018) serves as the band’s debut LP, part stylistic rebirth and part distillation of every quirk and feature that has made Honyock distinctly appealing since they first appeared. Produced by Father John Misty's David Vandervelde, it features the band's nimble songwriting with a playful pop sensibility, allowed to breathe in the loose-feeling structures of ballads and power-pop suites, imbued with the fractured grandeur of ‘70s guitar rock and glazed with the clean shimmer of ‘60s optimism, though it’s not without a minor touch of wistfulness to make the melodies bittersweet. Honyock regularly dips into serious territory while avoiding the theatrical pitfalls that can derail truly thoughtful handling of the subjects covered. They’re a group that can use artifice without becoming a background to it.

This track is taken from their latest four-song EP,​ ​Spool, ​and follows the release of the music video for ""20 Blanks"".

During the 7 years on stage and having released 3 LPs and 4 EPs, they've played more than 200 shows across the world including the Magnetic Fields festival in India, Dunk festival in Belguim, SXSW2018 in the USA and some epic sold out shows in Moscow.
Music of I am waiting for you last summer creates a special space for dreamers.
Listeners dive into the universe made of places you have been to, places you haven't and won't ever be. Imagination and personal experience make each journey unique.
Musicians work across the genres, the sound changes with every release: from experimenting with ambient textures to making loudspeakers shake the human body.
The trio's live shows capture listeners with energy and extensive palette of guitar sound mixed with the electronic vibe. The band builds a powerful wall of sound, that everyone dissolves into, finding something of their own, be it either a flight to fictional worlds or uncontrolled dancing drive.

776,Iguana Death Cult,"Rotterdam’s Iguana Death Cult hasn’t exactly been shy about causing havoc on whatever stage they set foot. That’s likely been the one constant since establishing their giddy brand of protopunk and garage rock on debut LP 'The First Stirrings Of Insect Life'. Iguana’s pending follow-up 'Nude Casino' marks a swift and sobering departure from the miasma of psychedelics they purvey so fervently. But no less intense: this band has been sharpening their tools, reemerging from their concrete cavern with a ragged and convulsive post-punk attack akin to Devo, The Gun Club, and Richard Hell.
Playing an abundance of shows – at small clubs, squats and festivals such as The Great Escape, Lowlands, c/o pop, Plissken and Reeperbahn – has whipped Iguana into even more ferocious live band, and that experience carries over in the recordings. Like The Clash and Minutemen before them, Iguana Death Cult have embraced the art of rocking the fuck out with all senses and impulses up to eleven. Rapturously sinking in their claws, and never letting go.

777,The Iguanas,"Based out of New Orleans for the past couple of decades -- save for a short, Katrina-imposed exile in  Austin — the members of the Iguanas have (collectively or individually) played or recorded with everyone from Charlie Rich, Alex Chilton, and Willie DeVille to Emmylou Harris, Allen Toussaint, and Pretty  Lights. Their two-decade ride  has taken them  all over the  map  musically  and  geographically, yet the inescapable patina of their hometown infuses every note they play. Through  eight  studio  albums,  countless  tours  and  Jazz  Fest  appearances,  and  a  flood  that  did  its best  to  take  their  adopted  city  with  it,  it's  a  testament  to  the  band's  endurance  that  the  same  four guys  that  started  playing  in  the  early  1990s  are  still  together.  Joe  Cabral is  philosophical  about  the bandʼs  persistence  in  the  face  of  challenges  that  would  have  felled — indeed have felled — lesser bands. “First of all, this is all we know how to do; weʼre musicians. But more than that,” he continues, “we respect the power of the band as an entity, and each individual in the band steps up to play his part. When itʼs good, thatʼs really what itʼs all about.

778,I Know Leopard,"I Know Leopard continue to establish themselves as one of Australia's most unique and exciting art pop outfits. The Sydney quartet explode their emotions into a musical kaleidoscope, finding catharsis in the ethereal bliss of pop’s plastic, proggy past. At the core of it all is dedication to timeless songwriting.
Over the past few years, six consecutive singles have been added to high rotation on Australia's national radio broadcaster Triple J, accompanied by sold out shows around the country and appearances at festivals such as Laneway and Lost Paradise.  In August 2018 the band released the single 'Landmine', which has truly been the outfit's biggest statement to date. Indicative of the lofty ambition inherent in their debut album, 'Love Is A Landmine', slated for release in  2019, ""Landmine"" marks a new beginning for the band. It revels in shimmering 70's soft rock glory but it is the channeling of this influence into something exotic and new that has truly dazzled audiences. Released in February 2019, their follow up single ""Heather"" has people predicting that I Know Leopard's album will be one of the breakthrough Australian releases of the year.

780,Illiterate Light,"Spanning the better part of a decade, the creative evolution between Jeff Gorman and Jake Cochran is far from ordinary. The duo ran an organic farm in the Shenandoah Valley, toured the mid-Atlantic by bicycle,  and lived in small communities while pursuing modes of alternative education. Their eclectic background is mirrored in Illiterate Light's sound and lyricism, floating between postmodern confusion and vibrant, life-affirming optimism. Formed in the summer of 2015, Illiterate Light transcend expectations of typical rock music through their limitations as a duo. Gorman elevates his gritty guitar melodies and honest lyricism by stomping out thunderous synth bass with his feet as Cochran layers lush vocal harmony and explodes with body convulsing energy around his minimalist standing drum kit.  Gorman and Cochran’s incessant writing, commanding live performance, and near constant touring promise a bright future as they finish their debut album with Vance Powell (Jack White, Kings of Leon, Chris Stapleton) and Adrian Olsen (Foxygen, Natalie Prass). Their recent EP, “Sweet Beast"", is the first taste of what’s to come from Illiterate Light.

781,illuminati hotties,"Despite the pluralized nom de guerre, illuminati hotties is the creative outlet of Sarah Tudzin - a producer, engineer, and burrito aficionado hailing from the sprawl of Los Angeles. Armed with bright white shortveralls and a rotating line-up of Sarah’s bffs, illuminati hotties has been lighting up stages across SoCal since Fall 2016 with playfully interweaving guitar lines, relentless rhythmic momentum, and strikingly self-aware vocals. Lauded as local “tenderpunk pioneers,” illuminati hotties has perfected the blend of sweetness and ferocity, of celebration and despondency, in their debut album, Kiss Yr Frenemies.

At first listen, illuminati hotties is a sun-drenched, irreverent volley with the onset of adulthood, but as the listener dives deeper, they will find an earnest consideration of musical phrasing and deliberately crafted wordplay regarding the complexity of love, loss, and skateboarding. illuminati hotties’ live show challenges audiences to bring their deepest feels and fiercest moves to the floor, and has elicited comparisons to Best Coast, Angel Olsen, Courtney Barnett, and Alvvays.

The music is modern and retro and optimistic and bleak and carefree and apocalyptic all at once."" Those juxtapositions lie at the heart of ‘Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,’ Beverly’s thrilling debut LP under the Indianola moniker. Recorded at Shovels & Rope’s studio in Charleston, South Carolina, the collection stitches together a broad range of genres and eras, gleefully toying with decades of music history in order to create a sonic collage from an alternate timeline, one in which snarling garage rock guitars flare up alongside 60’s girl group melodies and greasers and punks party with velvet-voiced crooners. Beverly mines the past like a found footage artist, seizing on unexpected moments from long-forgotten productions in order to splice them together in a wholly new context. The result is utterly engrossing and infectious, a pop culture Frankenstein that sounds like Roy Orbison fronting The Sonics or Buddy Holly soundtracking a B horror flick.

785,Indigo Sparke,"Singer/songwriter from Australia, Indigo Sparke, has been transmuting her vivid experiences into music from a very early age.
Her presence transports you back to the Golden Era, when wild self expression was met with reverence. She invites you with her music to remember the importance of this freedom. 
Haunting and mesmerising, her ethereal angelic and at times eerie melancholic vocals, coupled with her deeply poetic storytelling take you through the chambers of a soulful youth who has loved, fallen and risen again to stand once more and sing her tales.
Her music slips between genres and epochs from indie-rock to folk-pop to poetic lyricism, influenced by Joni Mitchell, Jeff Buckley, Radiohead and The Doors.
Following the release of her EP 'Nightbloom' in 2016 Indigo has performed a number of solo shows across Australia and the US at festivals such as Splendour in the Grass and other intimate venues, as well as supporting bands and musicians such as Big Thief, Jack River, and Melody Pool to name a few.

797,ISLAND,"London four-piece ISLAND are an Alternative guitar band whose history is characterised by old friendships, close bonds, and an almost telepathic mutual understanding. Forming as teenagers when frontman Rollo Doherty’s acoustic bedroom project was treated to the boisterous backing of guitarist Jack Raeder, bassist James Wolfe and drummer Toby Richards in a dingy windowless practice room where they began to shape a sound which combined darkly twisting instrumental with a sweetly melodic songwriting nous that belied their age. The quartet released their debut EP ‘Girl’ in late 2015 and its shimmering refrains immediately turned heads. Their follow up EP 'A Place You Like' continued their undeniable rise and further garnered new fans both domestically and internationally. Early 2018 they released their critically acclaimed debut album, ‘Feels Like Air’.
The band’s live show is fearsomely tight and effervescently energetic through years of playing together week in, week out since their youth. Over the course of little more than a year, they sold out all their London headline shows including the iconic London KOKO and Scala, and shows at The Great Escape, London Calling and Reeperbahn.

As a Charlotte, NC native and current resident of Philadelphia, Ivy’s sound draws on a diverse set of influences. Sole is the product of the gospel and soul upbringing afforded by her hometown, the mainstream R&B and backpack hip hop of the late 90s and 2000s, and an organic obsession with indie rock that she’s cultivated into a soundscape that's all her own. 

Sole's debut mixtape project EDEN was released in April 2016 to a welcoming community of hip-hop heads and hipsters alike, and it was ranked #27 on Bandcamp’s Best Albums of 2016 list. In 2017, she released the two-part project EAST and WEST and was featured as Spotify’s Fresh Finds spotlight artist. After 3 projects, two tours, and a lot of wisdom gained, the self-released indie returned full force with her first full-length studio album, OVERGROWN, in September 2018.

Born in New Zealand but then transplanted to Australia and now the United States with a guitar, suitcase and songs, Jackie travels light but packs a heavy punch.
Jackie has had the honor to be the opening act for many of her musical heroes. Opening for Bonnie Raitt in New Zealand on her 2013 “Slipstream” tour was a dream-come-true. Jackie was invited back 2017 to join Bonnie Raitt on her “Dig in Deep” tour. Jackie opened for Foreigner, the Steve Miller Band, Boz Skaggs and Chris Isaak 2018. 
Jackie’s live performances captivate audiences. One reviewer of her show on the Tommy Emmanuel tour wrote: “Opening for a musical giant like Emmanuel would seem a daunting task, but Bristow was relaxed as her soulfully-seductive melodies reverberated within the auditorium. Her beautiful voice and earnest songs resonated with the audience, and they applauded her eagerly. Near the end of the show, Bristow joined Emmanuel on stage for an amazing duet that received a standing ovation.”

Singing in both Spanish and English, her songs explore love and relationships: how wonderful love can be but yet so painful and confusing at the same time; from unrequited love to “firsts” and “lasts”; about coping with and releasing emotions; learning to believe in yourself through it all; feeling out of touch and foreign in your homeland; and even long-distance relationships and seahorses… Her first EP will be released in 2019 and was produced by Rusty Santos, who also teamed up with Panda Bear on his forthcoming album Buoys. Their collaboration has been seamless and inspiring. As both have lived between California, New York and Mexico, they immediately agreed on the direction Jackie’s sound should take. When she appeared at SXSW in 2018, she was featured in NPR’s AUSTIN 100 and spotted by THE NEW YORK TIMES as one of the best acts of the festival.

Venson’s “…astonishing mix of raw soul, superb musicianship and laid back grace…” (Austin American Statesman) has been compared to the likes of Joss Stone, Amy Winehouse and fellow Austin native Gary Clark, Jr. Originally a classical pianist, Jackie picked up the guitar, shortly after graduating from Berklee College of Music, and made the giant leap from the tradition of classical music to the raw and gritty blues and soul.

817,James Cam'Ron,"
For Chicago-raised artist James Cam’Ron, the interplay of community has always proven central to everything he does, and the turn up has always been real. While many get into music or art to prove something, Cam’Ron’s foray into the sonic waves of the world was instead a natural outgrowth of the world he found himself occupying on a day to day basis. Nestled amongst a cross-section of talented, alternative-leaning hip-hop acts during the early days of the Chicago Renaissance, the Englewood native learned to play his part, observe and study while working on his own thematics to offer to the world.
“I come from sort of an alternative side of the scene and shit, I spent a lot of time watching everyone, going to parties and finding my way,” said Cam’Ron. “I was trying to be around everyone, around what was going on up north and up west, being at Music Garage, I was just trying to be where everything was poppin and felt a gravity pulling me that way.”
Having spent the last half-decade collaborating with a range of local talents across many mediums, James focus is aimed to bring the creatives of the city together with good vibes central to the theme as always.

After writing thousands of measures of classical music, though, Harris found himself drawn back to the country, folk, and rock music that had soundtracked his early childhood. He'd grown up listening to classic crooners like Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, Jim Croce, Patsy Cline, and Elvis. 
Harris began cutting his non-classical teeth with the Show Ponies, an Americana group based in L.A. He played guitar for the band and produced most of their albums, racking up several million Spotify streams along the way. 
""I love country music because it's built upon a collision of the sad and specific,"" says the songwriter, whose music evokes comparisons to imaginative Americana frontmen like Daniel Romano and Robert Ellis. ""I want to treat it like an art form. I want to show people how seriously devastating it can really be.""

Her EP, The Moths of What I Want Will Eat Me In My Sleep went down with aplomb on either side of the Atlantic earlier this year.

2018 also saw her taking slots at Latitude festival and The Great Escape and dates with Haley Heynderickx, Elbow and Belle and Sebastien.

It’s led by the lush and thoughtful ‘Marrow’.

VISIONARY 
In the early nineties, young Jim-E-O, a fresh transplant from Imo State, Nigeria, settled in New Haven Connecticut with his family. Enyinna Ogbaa, his birth name, would travel into Midtown Manhattan on the train and stare out the window, captivated by the frantic hustle & bustle of the Big Apple. Through NYC’s madness, there was a beacon whose sound, language, dress and art would open his eyes and command his attention - there was a connection. The CEO and founder of My Executive Room gazed at the promotional posters, heard the boom bap of Hip Hop’s “Golden Era” emanating from storefronts and cars, while the street’s hieroglyphics known as graffiti provided the backdrop. He was hooked! This love would propel him to branch out to follow his dream of becoming a artist. As an artist Jim-E-O was chosen to perform at a BET music matters showcase in Austin, Texas,which landed him on 106 & Park. 
Passionately pursuing his dream of becoming an artist Jim-E-O found his creative niche when he relocated to Austin Texas, the live music capital of the world.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Sync/Music Supervisors",Hip-Hop / Rap,R & B,"Austin, TX","Mar 14, 2019",8:00pm-8:10pm,The Main II,False
856,JM Stevens,"West Point, Mississippi native JM Stevens likes to wear a suit to work. Maybe it's all those times he watched his dad leave the house so full of purpose, so clearly identified as a working man. It’s an unassuming look for a power pop extraordinaire. 
Praise has piled up over the years. The Austin Chronicle tossed around phrases like “perfect summer album” and “rock-solid barroom pop salvation” to describe his work with Moonlight Towers, the band he founded in 2001. Little Steven Van Zandt named their song Heat Lightning the coveted title of “Coolest Song in the World” on his radio show, Underground Garage. Heavy airplay followed, and even legendary producer and Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham called the song one of his “tops of the year.” 
Stevens shrugs off the accolades and the criticism with equal aplomb. “I’m just tryin to make cool shit"" he says, with a serious expression, and what truly could be more profound than that? (Following the whims of his artistic vision remains his only prerogative.) 
Although newly minted as a solo performer, Stevens has already devoted a lifetime to music, and the proof is abundant. New album out this year.

The Arndt's unique combination of devastatingly powerful vocals, retro-infused guitar, and entrancing lyrics creates what's best described as an alternative-leaning throwback to pure, album rock. Press includes Baeble, Paste, Huff Post, Relix, Jam in The Van, and numerous others. Jocelyn, Chris, and their band perform hundreds of shows at legendary venues and festivals coast to coast. Their albums feature guests like G Love, Gov’t Mule’s Danny Louis, and Cory Wong of Vulfpeck. Their single ""Red Stops Traffic” cracked the Billboard Triple A Top 40 with radio airplay nationwide, while their album ""Go"" held the #2 position on The Jambands Top 30 Album Chart for 3 consecutive moths. Perhaps most amazingly, they’ve done all of this while balancing college at Harvard University. Come rock with them at SXSW!

864,John Paul White,"With The Hurting Kind, John Paul White has crafted a stunning album that draws on the lush, orchestrated music made in Nashville in the early 1960s. Yet these songs retain a modern feel, whether he's writing about overwhelming love, unraveling relationships, or the fading memory of a loved one.
White grew up in tiny Loretto, Tennessee, and now lives in Florence, Alabama, not far from Muscle Shoals. He has cultivated his career in Nashville for two decades, first as a songwriter for a major publisher, then as half of The Civil Wars – a groundbreaking duo that won four Grammy Awards before disbanding in 2012.
Because The Civil Wars were so hard to categorize, White has earned a fan base among indie rock listeners, folk audiences, Americana outlets, and AAA radio. So, what will happen if people hear The Hurting Kind and call it country? “Well, that doesn’t scare me in the least,” he says. “As a matter of fact, it kind of thrills me.”

This is where a 26-year-old NOLA native heard 70-year-old Harlem son, Bill Hudson, singing with the doo-wop outfit called Spank.
“They blew me away,” he recalls, “I grew up listening to artists like The Temptations, The Drifters, and James Brown, so it brought me back home.""
Kyle and bill bonded in the studio and continued to work together on creating some new tunes. “The first thing I said to him was, ‘I think you should find a younger guy, number one’,” laughs Bill. “I liked what Kyle was putting down though. It had a feeling. It wasn’t generic. There was no classifying it.”
“I just knew that the bond we had was special,” recalls Kyle. “I wanted to listen to his voice more and more. He’s a young guy at heart. There was a lot of patience from him, and his wisdom is so crucial to this band. We’re constantly learning from him.” 
Kyle shared a handful of demos with friend, Dustin DiSalvo, and after bringing together a collective of 11 musicians, John The Martyr was formed.

In April 2018, Vanderslice decided to leap back into his solo career with full force, hunkering down for over 50 days in his San Francisco studio Tiny Telephone in a process that yielded The Cedars—Vanderslice’s most ambitious record to date. The Cedars (Native Cat Recordings 2019) approaches the craft of songwriting from every direction but the front, in a non-linear process driven by drum machines, synthesizers, and an unpredictable palette of sonic textures. In an act of getting both figuratively and literally lost in the woods, Vanderslice finds himself favoring chaos and deconstruction over well-worn paths of familiar sounds and instrumentation.

Five experienced musicians have ever since been on a mission to tear down geographic and linguistic borders. Jonathan officially appeared on Croatian scene in November 2013 with a single “Maggie” which was an instant hit. Accolades from music professionals and audience were only confirmed upon release of their debut album “Bliss” in May the following year. Jonathan became one of the bands emerging on the regional music scene, being high in quality and most noticeable.
Not keen to confine their music to a single genre, they are quick to point out their past in alternative and punk rock scene.

A self-confessed workaholic and social recluse, Jonathan spends his days (and nights) in a dingy home office attempting to run his record label Lil’ Chief Records whilst simultaneously producing for other artists, directing and starring in music videos for duets about Cigarette Smoking (yes THAT video) and then somehow finding time to record his own material when he should be sleeping.
Bree began writing and performing music as a child and by age 13 had released on New Zealand's Flying Nun Records.
At age 19 he formed the band The Brunettes, writing and producing 4 albums and 4 EPs for them. The Brunettes went on to sign with Sub Pop before eventually disbanding in 2010.
Bree then slipped into the shadows, resurfacing in 2014 as a solo artist with his masked baroque band, and has now released 3 solo albums.

One thread that consistently moved through her work are those gorgeous classical elements; whether that’s her treatment of melody on the supple, piano-driven ‘Once Apart’, her exploration of tone on ‘Feral Thing’, or simply incorporating a string quartet on the title track, ‘In The Blank Space’ points to the future while looking back to her past. “I think that’s maybe why I’m not only an electronic artist, but I’m also not just a singer-songwriter,” she insists. “I do both. I produce and I write songs."" Her technical autodidacticism is allied to a searing ambition, an unrelenting creativity. It’s the sound of someone who utterly loves music bringing this creativity into resolute focus, a conversation between the organic and the digital, between her inner world and that urge towards communication.

Makes you wonder if you've just missed out. If you're a coward for never trying. If you were ever on the field in the first place. Out there is a pendulum that swings recklessly between madness and delicate precision.But what is recklessness without talent? What's a prisoner without his trade?

Her use of an unusual four-string electric tenor guitar gives the songs a bright, almost stripped-back quality that showcases Switzer's intimate lyrics and vocals, while Lawrence Gann’s tight drumming creates intricate undercurrents. Originally formed as a two-piece by Switzer and Gann in 2017 after the two became instant friends at a bar show, Labrador has grown over the last year with the addition of Grant Kempski’s lead guitar and Kent Genis’ steady bass.

Bolstered by recent tours with The Jesus And Mary Chain, INVSN and The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, on “Empty Sea” Laura Carbone delves deeper into the intoxicating mix of dark reverb-laden pop melodies, searing rock riffs and noisy feedback chaos hinted at on her debut album “Sirens”. Written partly in the gray claustrophobia of the German winter and finished in the vast golden expanse of the California desert and the gritty glare of L.A., “Empty Sea” boldly oozes the confidence and swagger of a survivor. Laura Carbone moves effortlessly here from sexy tribal stomp to delicate beauty, Brecht-ian mystique and beyond. Prepare to be charmed and disarmed, battered and bruised, to ultimately emerge from the depths of the “Empty Sea” grasping desperately for the “REPEAT” button.
Berlin-based Laura Carbone’s latest single, “The Flowers Beneath Your Feet”, saw her joining forces to duet with Kip Berman of NY’s The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart on this sparkling, noisy dream pop diamond-in-the-rough.

With a comically narcissistic persona and a domineering stage presence, LEX delivers surgically precise rapid-fire raps about things she likes, things she’s done, and things everyone else is too afraid to say.

1010,Leyla McCalla,"Leyla McCalla introduced herself with 2013’s Vari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes. She set poems by Hughes in musical settings of her own construction on the critically acclaimed album, and her plain-spoken voice highlighted the common sense in Hughes’ works. McCalla moved to New Orleans in 2010 to busk on the streets. She also toured as part of the Carolina Chocolate Drops but left to pursue her own music and the project that threaded through it—an exploration of Haiti’s Creole culture and identity. McCalla connected with other Louisiana musicians who work with Creole traditions. That led to 2016’s A Day For The Hunter, A Day For The Prey, which reveals the art and humanity in folk songs. McCalla has kept her instrumentation spare to allow the song to shine, but her upcoming album, The Capitalist Blues, departs from that as she plays with a New Orleans-based band. The Capitalist Blues is different from McCalla’s previous albums, but she hears the connection between New Orleans and Haiti. Many of the themes are extensions of ones she examined on A Day for the Hunter, a Day for the Prey, and even though the lineups are very different, the songs come from the same place.

1039,"Locate S,1","Having rotated between a handful of cast and characters under various titles over the years  (Jepeto Solutions, CE Schneider Topical, Christina Schneider's Genius Grant...) Schneider has settled on the pop moniker Locate S,1 for her newest album, Healing Contest.
Healing Contest stands out as the fully realized, high-fidelity collaboration pairing Schneider’s compositions with the iconic creative force behind of Montreal. Produced, engineered and mixed by Kevin Barnes, Healing Contest is the debut release from Barnes' new label, Sybaritic Peer.
On Healing Contest, Schneider is back with a futuristic palette of electronic drums, funky bass lines, and quietly hyperactive chord progressions that are sure to impress even the most learned musical millennial. Locate S,1 is the result of a seasoned songwriter cum lo-fi home-recorder delving into the world of mid-fi pop, with results that are pleasantly difficult to define; a technical tour-de-force that extrapolates high-brow jazz harmonics and prog-rock time signatures into a whole menagerie of new forms—all while still passing as pop.

Nashville eventually exerted its pull on him. “This was a further expression of my archaeological impulse with regards to music-making—I’ve always believed that in order to create something new with purpose, one must be steeped in the past and work from within the tradition (it has more gravity that way).” He continues, “In Nashville I began writing songs in earnest—I wanted to write country music that evoked the darker, mysterious side of human nature and experience.” Renowned bassist Dennis Crouch introduced Ledger to legendary producer T Bone Burnett. Burnett immediately felt musical kinship to Ledger. He signed him to a production deal and facilitated a deal with roots label Rounder Records. Ledger says, “It has been a real privilege to work with T Bone. We share a musical vision for the twenty-first century born from the deep well of American music.” As Kyle Corneos of Saving Country Music predicts, “you’ll want to be paying attention when Logan Ledger hits.”

1062,Löwin,"Heavy As the Sun is Löwin’s second release but marks a rebirth in sound for the Austin based quartet.  While Royal Jelly (released in 2013) asserted the band as a member of the Austin rock scene, Heavy as the Sun emerges with a more shimmery pop aesthetic on intro tracks “Sake” and “Maybe It’s Over.” Songwriter/singer Sara Houser switches from guitar to keyboards (her primary instrument) to create a uniformly synth centered record. “I wanted the focus of this record to be more lyrically and melodically driven and for me those ideas come the most naturally when I’m playing piano,” explains Houser. 
That being said, Heavy as the Sun doesn’t lack dynamics or the bombastic post rock moments that are more present in Löwin’s earlier releases. Amidst the glitz are songs like “Hard to Love” which starts off with heavy hitter Chris DeGeorge and Nate Ribner’s signature bass fuzz but then builds into a B52s inspired banger. Guitarist Michael Sanders shines on “Sloop” and “The Wheel” with tones reminiscent of Real Estate and Johnny Greenwood alike. 
Heavy as the Sun was recorded in Austin, TX.

When you listen to her songs, you have the feeling of being in this dream: walking alone in the woods, sometimes spooked and sometimes elated, and you are uncertain whether or not you will wake up in a familiar place. Bond (guitar and vocals) formed Meernaa with Rob Shelton (keys) in Oakland in 2015. They are natural collaborators (both work as engineers at John Vanderslice’s recording studio Tiny Telephone) who draw influence from the environments of the Bay Area, where the shift between dramatic landscapes can be hard to perceive. Bond’s songs are expansive and arresting; what starts as an amorous croon can transform into a full psychedelic eruption. The debut EP Strange Life arrived on Native Cat Recordings in spring 2018, and a new full-length album Heart Hunger (Native Cat Recordings) will be released in June 2019.

1137,Merely,"In ancient stories, fairy tales and mythology, different tropes are often used to symbolise the powers found within all of us; for example, The King and Queen represents internal struggle and justice, and The Warrior represents courage and willpower. On the other hand, The Wizard is more ambiguous and represents the esoteric sides of the human psyche - insight, spiritual growth, a kind of messenger between worlds. 
If Merely’s first two albums “Nirvana” and “Uncanny Valley” were her manifestations of The Warrior and The Queen, “Hatching The Egg” is The Wizard - a new incarnation, imagining her as the lead singer in a super group composed of the best renderings of her past self, all disguised as fable animals and creatures from the other side; an album painted with a palette of psychedelic, dreamy pop, shoegaze, chamber music and subtle hints of progressive rock.

1157,Miya Folick,"Miya Folick’s debut album Premonitions — out on Terrible Records and Interscope — is a vision of a more compassionate human future. “I wanted to imagine an existence that’s more natural — where we understand ourselves with more subtly,” Folick says. On Premonitions, she creates a communal world where people care for each other, are demanding of each other, and, sometimes, just want to be alone. 
Pervading Folick’s distilled, haunting, and emotionally immediate first two EP’s -- Strange Darling (2015) and Give It To Me (2017) -- is a sense of deep empathy and desire for connection, but also a tendency toward solitude. Perhaps these themes can be traced to her upbringing in the Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist tradition, where her parents taught her about living with mindfulness — though, she says, she doesn’t always remain true to this in her own life. Or, it could be from the eternal sense of not quite belonging that Folick has carried since growing up as a child of mixed heritage in the suburban neighborhoods of Santa Ana, California. Being an outsider created a tendency in Folick to observe the nuances of how others experience connection or lack thereof.

Unlike Please Be Mine, which focused on the contentious depression of heartbreak, First Flower explores broken friendships, her relationship to her sister, and more importantly, how Burch learned to fight overwhelming anxiety. Burch is a soft-spoken, careful person who shoves her nervousness away on a daily basis. First Flower is a bright, beautiful album peppered with moments of triumph.

1174,&More (Chill Moody & Donn T),"When it comes to the dynamic between rapper Chill Moody and singer Donn T, the two couldn’t be more aligned. The Philadelphia-based musicians, who met at an industry party in late 2016, knew of each other’s music prior to their first encounter, but soon decided to share ideas with one another in the studio and independently came to the same conclusion: to form a group and create along the same wavelength.
“There are a lot of instances of finishing each other's sentences or those unspoken things,” explains Chill. “Right now, music is the vessel we’re using to advance the message of inspiration, motivation, healing and upliftment,” adds Donn T. “But, at the core, that’s who we both are. So, it’s not surprising for us to have some kind of community service initiative or social justice effort connected to our shows or the music, something or other that we’re a part of, that helps make our surroundings, the world or maybe just one person’s life, better. That’s key.”

1177,Moritz Simon Geist,"Moritz Simon Geist is a media artist, engineer and robotic musician. Each sound in his mind-blowing performances is played by robots. Small motors beat on metal, 3D-printed robo-kalimbas vibrate with deep bass sounds, salvaged parts from old hard drives click and cut. Over several years Moritz Simon Geist committed to build, tweak, test and play all of his DIY robotic instruments.
Geist’s ‘Sonic Robots’ push the boundaries of the imaginable and invent a new plurality in music creation. In electronic music, many imagine humans playing machines. Few imagined these music machines being actual robots. In 2012, Geist ventured into this exploration with the invention of his well-known oversized MR-808 robot. Now, he goes even further to pioneer the unknown and futuristic sound world of ‘Robotic Electronic Music’.
In this quest, Geist teamed up with the Berliner sound alchemists ‘Mouse On Mars‘ to dig deep into the history of mechanical music and experiments of early electronic music. In 2018 he releases the first ever techno record made with only robots on his Label SRR with help from KOMPAKT.

Creating songs of both eulogy and revolution, the expansion of 21st century black consciousness is felt in waves through Ohio’s Mourning A BLKstar. A force that has deep conviction, purpose, and weight, songs are voiced through a lens of chopped up drum grooves, stark melodies, washed-out synth tones, and historic sample pulls.
On their sophomore album, The Garner Poems, the group traffics their signature gritty strain of DIY Afrofuturist soul music, balancing hip-hop production techniques with lo-fi experimentation to create a sonic suite that eulogizes victims of police brutality, including Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, as well as bringing forth a conversation that aligns with the political and emotional state of this world. The Garner Poems are modern day spirituals of reverence and despair that serve as both a force of light and a schematic for hope, survival, and independence.

After spending her teens in the highly competitive opera world, she studied jazz at the University of Montreal. 
It wasn’t until September of 2017 that Boivin found her calling, when a friend invited her to play the legendary Pop Montreal festival. At that point, she only had one finished song. “I realized that this was my chance,” she says. “If I was ever going to make my own music, it was now. I quit my job and moved in with my sister, just so I could write all day.”
After her sister would leave for work every day, Boivin set up her gear, transforming the kitchen into a recording studio, where she wrote and recorded, cleaning everything up before her sister got home at five. These recordings, coupled with a few in-studio days with Miles Dupire-Gagnon and Gabriel Lambert from Anemone, would eventually become her debut EP

Nadia´s battle-ready juxtaposition of DIY pop, frantic electronics and enthralling, fragile melodies is a mixture of musical nuances that inevitably reflects the approach that she’d rather raise her voice than lower it.

Paste Magazine heralded them as one of NYC’s must know bands of 2018. Their debut EP, Songs Born From Love and Hate dropped in November 2017 via PaperCup Music/Buen Dia Records. Remezcla called it “rock, with plenty of melody and attitude, resulting in a collision of classic CBGBs punk, and power pop melodies.” Native Sun reflects the sound of immigrant America, as noted by Noisey. 
Frontman Danny Gomez met lead guitarist Jake Pflum as a kid in Florida. Life led them apart and reunited them on a random evening in the city. They rekindled their friendship over their mutual obsession with The Rolling Stones, VU, T. Rex, Neil Young, etc. Immediately, they forced their best friend Alexis Castro to pick up the drum sticks. Bassist Mo Martinez came to them at the height of 2016’s turmoil after uprooting from Monterrey, Mexico and naturally completed the band’s lineup.

The way that we fear how people will see us if we show them. The way we can’t stand to look deep inside if it means we’re to face the demons we’ve buried. Sometimes we write and write and write and nothing comes out but sometimes - just sometimes - we write and something beautiful happens. 
Nicotine rose from the stories that Brianna Zepeda had yet to tell. The ones that kept her up at night, the ones that haunted her like the broken record memories that we ignore until they come out in fits of passion. With those stories, An Open Letter was born. Seven full tracks of raw, passionate, and vulnerable sentiments, drawn out from love; From being a pansexual afrolatina; From Houston-meets-New York-meets-paper and pen; From trying to find home when you’ve left the only place you’ve ever called home; From the stories of natural disasters that call us back. A moment in time led to releasing the album digitally and never looking into the past. Soon after, Nicotine performed live in Nylon studios and received critical acclaim from Afropunk, Hilly Dilly, Refinery29 and more, touting Nicotine “provides us with licks of soul, R&B, funk and early 2000Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.Artist is seeking the following professional connections: Label, Brand Partnership, Gear Endorsement, Distribution - UK/Europe, Distribution - Worldwide, Other Artists to Tour With, Booking Agent - US, Booking Agent - UK/Europe, Booking Agent - Worldwide, PR/Publicity Agency, Producer/Studio Engineer, Publishing, Sync/Music Supervisors",R & B,Soul,"Houston, TX","Mar 13, 2019",12:00am-12:40am,Augustine,False

As it transpires the present is the time when you can finally let go of the past because the future is now, and the future is The Night Thief.

	Nodding with great sensitivity and playfulness to the sounds of the '90s and '00s, along with a rich musical education (The Beatles and Elvis Costello at her mom's, Marvin Gaye and Gram Parsons, then later on Fiona Apple, Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush), Norma never appears twice the same way. Heady melodies, twisted harmonies, and her own dark groove, velvet vocals and intimate lyrics give the record a timeless unique style, shifting from dark trip-hop to witty RnB, from bestial house to the final country ballad. 
	A fiery, independent artist who never shies away from murky waters, Norma takes her time, without concessions. She's releasing her first album “Female Jungle”, co-produced with artist Ryder The Eagle, on her own label Shortcuts.

Lacey dismisses his early musical efforts as painfully emo, but in 2013 he volunteered to write the score for a friend’s feature film. For the climactic scene he wrote a song he called From Gold. “What I liked about it was that the whole song was one crescendo,” he explains. ""Though it’s just four chords repeated over again for three and a half minutes, it’s the simplest thing, and simplicity is key sometimes.”
‘From Gold’ unlocked something in Lacey. Singles Faux and Alps, both collaborations with friend and artist Ed Tullett. These were followed by a second solo EP, Bathing Beach. In November 2017 he released a full-length collaborative album with Ed Tullett, Heiress. His debut album Birthplace was released on October 19th 2018, via the AllPoints label.

Born in England and raised in the inner western suburbs of Sydney, Odette grew up with an eclectic musical palette. Her South African mother introduced her to African music, soul, funk and rhythm; while her English father, hailing from a long line of jazz pianists, introduced her to new wave, jazz and passed on his musical talents.
Odette has played piano since she was a child and her highly emotive use of the instrument lives at the centre of her songs, a grounding motif of her heritage.

Oh Pep! released their second full-length, I Wasn’t Only Thinking About You...(Oct 26 on ATO/People Speak Records)— have always been as driven as they have been wildly creative. The duo met almost a decade ago, while attending a performing arts high school in Melbourne and it was fateful. 
They wrapped up touring their debut album ‘Stadium Cake’ at Glastonbury in 2017. That year they had shared stages with heroes like Billy Bragg, Lake Street Dive, Martha Wainwright, Valerie June and the Mountain Goats. NPR enthused that they were “thoughtful, deep, funny, and poetic.” The New York Times marveled at how adept they were at “sharing a melody that’s both angular and affectionate.” 
Now with their sophomore, Oh Pep! explore the melody-rich expanse between indie pop and alt-folk, while dipping into themes of growing older, and seeing the world.

Ever heard of the band KISS? How about Joni Mitchell? Ever been walking down a street and you pass by a neighbors rose garden and one reminds you of someone? So you reach out to pick it. But someone is screaming at you to get off their damn lawn so now you’re pulling, and the thorns are digging into your skin but the bloom is beautiful and who was it for, who was it for?
In the four years since forming, Oh, Rose has toured the US four times, and provided support for both Future Islands and Reptar on the west coast. Their most recent release, Seven, garnered write-ups in Gold Flake Paint, Portland Mercury and Bandcamp Daily while their debut EP, That Do Now See, was praised in blogs The Needle Drop and Nerdist.

1269,Ohtis,"The beautifully dark country-Americana and lyrical onslaught of 'Runnin' is a fitting introduction to songwriter Sam Swinson's autobiographical journey through indoctrination and addiction; an endlessly inviting confession from his past battles with substance abuse, and the religious demons lingering from his upbringing in a fundamentalist evangelical cult.
Ohtis originally formed when Swinson and co-founder Adam Pressley were at high school in Normal, Illinois. They self-released their first material on small run CD-Rs while still teenagers. 
By 2009, Swinson's addiction became life-threatening. Pressley and pedel steel player Nate Hahn had to distance themselves and the band dissolved. They kept in touch whilst living in different parts of the country, swapping ideas and songs online, never planning to release them, in equal parts because of their traumatic falling-out, and Sam's ongoing addiction to heroin.
Redemption eventually came in the form of sobriety for Swinson. After making 9th step amends to both of his re-joining bandmates, they brought Ohtis back to life.

His parents moved to the US to give their kids a better life and the opportunity to go to college; however, Omar always knew this route wasn’t meant for him. He began playing guitar at 12 years old, but quit soon after because he got bored of only playing in church. At age 18, Omar began listening to new styles of music and fell in love with the guitar again. His biggest influences are Benny Sings, D'angelo, Los Panchos, John Mayer, Elliott Smith, Cuco Sánchez, Paul Simon, Gary Numan, and João Gilberto. Omar released his debut EP, STEREO, this past summer and followed it up recently with a single called Today featuring producer/songwriter Teo Halm.

1278,The Ophelias,"Through a blend of understated rock, baroque pop and wide-skied atmospheres, The Ophelias explore the juxtapositions of youth in their album Almost.
Having formed the band while still in high school, the members first met at a time when each were independently serving as the “token girl” in various dude-bands from their hometown of Cincinnati, OH.
Coming from varied musical backgrounds (ranging from garage-rock, to surf, to opera), the distinct talents and influences of each member collided in unexpected ways at the band’s first rehearsal. It was here the band discovered that their chemistry wasn’t rooted in a shared musical reference point, but in the creative relief from the expected censorship of being a sideperson.
​Produced by Yoni Wolf (WHY?), the new album Almost glides between palatial assuredness and pallid introspection, looking back on youthful yearning—the uncertainties, the traumas, the anxieties—without discounting its soft beauty. 
The Ophelias steer Almost through the lineage of coming-of-age confessionals, and affectionately document their growth into a warm, fractured adulthood.

Ori Alboher , is a multi-instrumentalist creator that has been making music from his home studio under the name ORI since 2012.
Inspired by R&B, Pop, Ambient and Soul, ORI shares his music with a soft voice, manipulated vocals, loops and beats - building up melodic, rhythmic and repetitive structures that pulls the listener into the music while forming moods oscillating between intimacy and distant depths.
ORI floods the listener with strong currents and powerful spells. ORI’s style could best be described as ‘Heartcore’.
“The Song ‘Solo’ By ORI from his latest album ‘1986’ was sampled by Jay Rock on his song ‘For What It’s Worth’ from his new album ‘Redemption’, the sample serves as the chorus of the song and features ORI singing “Is It Worth It, Maybe When You Go Home, I Don’t Want To Be Here, Try Not To Think About It”
The sample was picked by Kendrick Lamar (Who curated the album) & Producer Sounwave (Who produced the song).
ORI released his latest album ‘1986’ in November of 2017 and has been touring with it since. ORI is now working on his next (3rd) album to be released in 2019.

1282,Orions Belte,"Is it blues? Is it world music? Is it underground pop? You can choose whichever you want, it’s not important for Orions Belte to be pigeonholed. They’re playing instrumental music inspired by Nigerian 70’s rock, postcards from the French Riviera, Formula One races at the Monza track in Italy, and when Joe Frazier beat Muhammad Ali in the ‘Fight of the Century’ in 1971. Eclectic and unique.
Øyvind Blomstrøm and Chris Holm mainly make a living out of being on the road with other bands, and they’re almost always traveling from town to town, country to country. When their roads crossed for the umpteenth time in 2016, their mutual dream of starting an instrumental project was finally underway. Holm’s companion from the Bergen scene, Kim Åge Furuhaug, wanted to join in on the fun, and then Orions Belte was born. 
Their debut album «Mint» is founded on old traditions but still feels new, and you’ll have to look for a long time to find anything like it. Texas band Khruangbin may be the best comparison as per today, but Orions Belte really belongs in their own galaxy. A galaxy where they are the soundtrack to movies that haven’t been made yet.

His work led him to stand out and be awarded with the best student in his program. Living in Miami taught him the art of songwriting. Today, years after, he has more than 100 finished songs and a catalogue that keeps growing constantly. His project officially began when he released his first single “Fue Tan Solo Un Beso” (2014), which made the top charts in Colombia for more than 3 months. He then continued to increase his fan base by performing live in different cities and festivals, and was able to start his own YouTube channel in which he uploads high quality content that has over 14.000.000 views. Pablo released his EP “Mi Media Mitad” in 2018 and began working on his first LP under Alan Saucedo’s production in Mexico City.

Through prolific touring and recording, they have developed a dedicated nation-wide following without the aid of a major label. In their formative years, Palberta’s live performances often involved moments of synchronized dancing and humorous performance art in between songs or during them. Over the course of the last 5 years, they have developed a reputation as a “must-see” live band on the DIY circuit, honing in on a distinct and arresting sound incorporating gorgeous three part harmonies into their chaotic grooves. Roach Goin' Down is Palberta's most impressive album to date. 22 tracks combine the band's signature frenetic instrumentation with a thoroughly developed pop sensibility that was a mere glimpse on previous releases. The songs are lovingly crafted and shine with the confidence of a band discovering new musical possibilities and having a blast doing it.

When contacted, however, by a venue to perform in an upcoming show, The Pantones immediately rebranded and recorded two singles by themselves. The band records their instruments in a bedroom while vocals in their high school's ROP room. After the release of the two singles, comparisons to the jangly guitar riffs of The Smiths were quickly made. In November of 2017, the group released the EP ""For The Ones Who Love You."" After being inspired by the 1981 single ""Primary"" by The Cure (where Gallup and Smith were both playing bass), two bass guitars became a prominent feature of the EP. After being inspired by self-produced acts in the 1980s (The Cleaners From Venus, The Hit Parade, etc.), The Pantones decided to self-record and release two new singles in September of 2018.

1309,Parker Gispert,"Parker Gispert Sunlight Tonight 
Parker Gispert was still in college when he helped form the Whigs in the early 2000s. But after five critically-acclaimed albums, hundreds of tour dates all over the world with the likes of Kings of Leon, Drive-By Truckers, the Black Keys and many others, and television appearances everywhere from the Late Show with David Letterman to Jimmy Kimmel Live! , the Athens, Georgia-bred rockers decided to pull back on activity in 2017. 
Which left Gispert, who had spent the majority of his adult life either in the studio or on the road with the band, at a crossroads. 
“It occurred to me that if I wanted to record and tour that I was going to need to do it solo,” the singer, songwriter and guitarist says. “I'd always thought about it in the back of my mind as something that I wanted to do one day, but ‘one day’ had never really come.” 
Now, ‘one day’ is here in the form of Sunlight Tonight , Gispert’s debut solo album (produced and mixed by Emery Dobyns). The eight-song effort finds Gispert, known for leading the Whigs through raw and jangly southern-garage rave-ups, taking a decidedly different musical approach—biting electric guitar riffs are cast out in

Moving to Austin, opened a whole new world. Said Byrne, “I’ve never felt so alive musically. Every night I go see a gig; and I’m blown away. I get opportunities to play with those people, and it’s inspiring.” 
Pat recently released his new LP, “Rituals”. The artistic growth is clear; the authenticity is palpable. No one genre dictates the mix—and the tracks get better with each listening.
“The results—Irish Americana, by turns rollicking and resonating, that’s driven by his gruff growl of a voice—suggest that he’s one to keep an eye on.” Stuart Munro, The Boston Globe
“The raspy melodic soul of Byrne’s voice recalls the emotional spells the late Austin troubadour Jimmy LaFave used to cast, though Byrne’s songwriting bears a distinctive Irish stamp. He’s more contemporary than strict traditionalists, putting him more in the league of Glen Hansard or Luka Bloom, perhaps; yet at times he conjures a deeply old-school feel,” Peter Blackstock, Austin American Statesman

A quintet of live music blending acoustic instrumentation with electronic inputs and different vocal styles, their outlook on life and music refuses to be boxed in. Over the years, the bandmates have ebbed and flowed, but now they've reached their final form with these five original members: Elbee Thrie on vocal duties, Aja Grant on the keys, drummer Matt Byas, guitarist Elijah Rawk, and bassist Bari Bass. Their sound is a mix of soul, R&B, funk, hip hop, jazz, pop, and everything between and beyond. It's very DIY, too. They do their own songwriting, arrangement, mixing, and production. Like their sound, they avoid being fenced into one type of performance. You might catch them on a big stage at a festival, or at a more intimate venue like the legendary Blue Note in Manhattan.

In doing so she’s found her place. Along the way she’s found a number of other people who have seen the beauty in what she’s created, including plaudits from the likes of John Kennedy (Radio X), Huw Stephens (Radio 1) as well

1365,Postdata,"“‘Tis a fearful thing, to love what death can touch.”
That phrase, written by 11th century Spanish philosopher and poet Judah Halevi, reconciles two conflicting certainties: we will love, and what we love will die. We will be loved; we, too, will die. The two seem antithetical, like two sides of a coin, as if something’s worth is undermined by its mortality. But they coexist. In a certain light, they even complement one another. There is courage inherent in building a community that we will one day leave. Though we will cease to exist, the love we share is not necessarily terminal.
On Let’s Be Wilderness, his new record with revolving-door project Postdata, Paul Murphy explores both sides of that coin. The frontman of beloved Nova Scotia alternative outfit Wintersleep, Murphy has built a circle of collaborators, friends, and family around him for more than a decade. Murphy first released music with Postdata in 2010, a self-titled debut that saw him working with his brother Michael to record a set of songs that dealt with family, legacy, and connection. Now, Postdata returns with Let’s Be Wilderness, a record characterized by those two old bickering friends: love and death.

Their Sun Damage EP in 2012 and their debut LP, 2013’s Hell Bent, put them on the map, and the subsequent years of touring and an acclaimed self-titled EP in 2015 reinforced their status as one of punk’s most rock-solid and talented upstarts.

1383,Psychedelic Porn Crumpets,"Take the trail out of Perth via Leederville and keep on driving, and you might just stumble across an old horse shed – one where weirdness roams free. Across the bridge from said shed, house parties rage until the early hours and beyond, while around the corner there’s a sky-high pile of trash that acts as a makeshift home for the local rat population. It’s here, amongst jam sessions that would last six-hours plus, that the wacky, sprawling sound of Psychedelic Porn Crumpets was born.

“It had a tin roof, so it was really nice when it rained,” reveals the band’s frontman and ringleader Jack McEwan – an idyllic image that’s quickly scrawled over when he recounts a tale of said roof tearing off in the wind one night. “I used to have to wake up at 3am and spray myself with bug spray,” he adds with a shrug. Composing songs on an old, out-of-tune piano, and hooking up projectors to their amps to beam warped imagery around the clapped-out barn, their wonky approach to music-making took root amongst the hay. “We got too many noise complaints,” he admits, revealing that they’ve since decamped to a seaside home where they can make as much racket as they please. “It got into fine territory,

A Brooklyn DIY super group of sorts, Public Practice combines members of freshly-dead punk project WALL and local pop band Beverly. Public Practice backs their ambitious song writing with serious chops, their live shows already pulling them into the sharp foreground of a scene growing all too warm-and-fuzzy.
Sam York’s lyrics reflect the city and it’s contradictions—they are personal, funny, cryptic and surreal, but never truly pessimistic, rotating around an individual’s toxic but symbiotic relationship with perception. Songs like the sarcastically-titled “Foundation” deep-fry Beach Boys guitars in ice-cold-but-somehow-funky Scritti Politti grooves. Add a dead pan David Byrney vocal, and Public Practice remind us again how integral it is to use honesty and self-reflection to bring some of life’s double-standards to light.

Now based in Melbourne, 2018 marked the Australian release of debut record ‘We’ll Go Riding on the Hearses’ through Hotel Motel, and it could be a sleeper hit. NPR somehow thought so, naming Quivers a best new emerging artist at the end of 2018. Half men and women, everyone-singing, there is grit and spit and community in their live shows. You might hear the ghosts of early R.E.M. guitars, the earnest lost pop moments of The Go-Betweens and The Chills, or the tight looseness of Modest Mouse and The Walkmen. All we really know for sure is the chorus of Pigeons sure feels good to shout, ‘All my best friends are a little broken, all the best people are’.

These new knights include King Richard Owens of Chicago, Yul Dorn, Jr. of the Bay Area, CA, and Mark Scurlock, Jr. of Jackson, MS.  Together, they fashion an expansive range of fresh musical concepts, sonic effects, a mix of vocal and instrumental R&B/jazz styles and a forward thinking, 21st Century approach to the classic styles recorded and performed for decades by The Crusaders. Sample said of them, “When I accepted the position at Texas Southern University I aimed to teach students the art form of playing and recording music at a high level. The students who became RADS Krusaders, opened their hearts and ears to what I needed to share with them from my experience and point of view. The hard work these guys developed in their performance, compositions/arrangements and personality allowed me to appreciate teaching, and it was a lot of fun.""

Already drawing lines around the block at home, the globe-trotting group’s singular take on rock n’ roll mixes punk rock energy, horn drenched soul, and jazz precision, all with a lighthearted but sincere delivery. It’s a sound and show that is gaining steam world over as The Rad Trads continue to tour in support of On Tap, out now from Hornblow Recordings. Challenging but humorous, at times The Rad Trads bring to mind Springsteen and his “Big Man” Clarence Clemons, Dylan’s Blood On The Tracks-era vocal style, and Wilco’s epic guitar breakdowns. All of this sonic goodness is only upstaged by the fact that the guys in The Rad Trads manage to exist as five distinct songwriters and singers in a band that still sounds powerfully egoless, familial, and cohesive.

Things took off from there as they both shared similar influences, similar backgrounds and similar mindsets and visions. 
They started as a duo, with their first gig together being an open mic at a church. The duo became a trio and started playing anything from house parties, to bars, to coffee shops, to open mics. Things started moving fast as the release of ‘We Bring Anything to the Table… Except Tables, We Can’t Bring Tables to the Table’, garnered unexpected attention. They have continued playing and noticed a growth in their audience throughout the years since.

1433,red steppes,"
A Mouth May Grow (Native Cat Recordings 2018) is the first full length album from red steppes. Helmed by songwriter and photographer Nika Aila States, recorded and mixed to tape at Tiny Telephone in Northern California, the songs are built from organic and felt performances, drawing their aesthetic language from the bounded period of long days and evenings in the studio, from the generous imitations of analog tape. Driving the album's musical exploration is a deep respect for folk music, age-old melodic traditions, and for the experimental and irreverent.
The songs saunter through mapped points on the Western coast of the US, explore growth and decay, and interrogate narrative tropes surrounding love, gender, and industry. Nika's wider artistic practice as a visual artist can't help but find its way into her musical work: a yearning for a sense of place, the positioning of botany and landscape as teacher and translator, and the pregnant silence of uninhabited places.
States currently lives in Brooklyn, where she is preparing her second full-length release, pursuing a Geography degree, and exploring a bridge between textile arts and photography.

For their powerful new album, ‘The Wanting,’ the band handed production duties over to acclaimed singer/songwriter Will Hoge, who helped them create their most ambitious, fully realized collection yet. Recorded in Nashville, TN, the record draws on many of the group’s traditional strengths—indelible melodies, infectious hooks, explosive performances—even as the making of it pushed them far outside their comfort zone and forced them to take an unprecedented, nearly year-long break from touring.

1440,*repeat repeat,"*repeat repeat was founded by Jared Corder — a former punk-rock kid raised on the sounds of Bad Religion & Black Flag. The goal was simple: to make edgy, guitar-driven music that nodded to the classic sounds of Jared's California birthplace, complete with hazy harmonies and surf-inspired arrangements. The problem? The group needed a female harmony singer, and nobody seemed to fit the bill. Things changed when the band's producer suggested that Jared's wife, Kristyn, sing with the band. The fit was natural. Kristyn had grown up in California, listening to '60s legends like the Mamas and the Papas & The Everly Brothers. She quickly completed the band, sharing vocal duties with Jared and serving as the inspiration for much of Bad Latitude — a debut album largely written by Jared during the couple's engagement.
Floral Canyon (their sophomore album) stretches the band's musical envelope, adding depth, drive, and darkness to the sun-baked, surf-tinged pop that's always been their bedrock. Gluing everything together is the band's melodic, musical attack: equal parts percussive thunder, trembling organ, synth pads, coed harmonies, and wide-ranging guitar parts.

Within their self-defined genre of “dreamwave”, musical influences ranged from Gary Wilson-esque jazzy/lounge chord progressions, to the warmth of Broadcast’s recording production and fidelity, to Todd Rundgren-esque outer space synth sounds.  In their first year as an active band, Reptaliens signed to Brooklyn’s Captured Tracks label and released their debut album.

The EP was also well-recieved by the press and public. One of the songs (Go) was featured in the tv series ""SKAM"".

1465,Robbie Fulks & Linda Gail Lewis,"Wild! Wild! Wild!, the new collaboration between Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks and rock-and-roll royalty Linda Gail Lewis, gleefully lives up to its title. It’s Americana music that’s as butt-shakin’ as Beale Street, deep-rooted as the Grand Ole Opry, and hip as a trip to The Strip. Subversive as it is reverential, the album jumps the genre tracks of nitty-gritty rock-and-roll, country-and-western, rockabilly, jump swing, and gospel, landing in a strange slice of spacetime—call it 1954—when all these were One (and Linda was 7). 
Robbie Fulks, the record’s producer, is “one of the most observant and wry songwriters of the past two decades” (Rolling Stone). Ground-zero Louisiana-born rocker Linda Gail Lewis is the younger sister and frequent performing partner of Jerry Lee Lewis, whose piano innovations she carries forward. Her present-at-the-creation cred buoys the record while Robbie—who sings, plays, leads the band, writes most of the songs, and arranges the others—provides an anchoring sensibility, one that savors old sounds but sidesteps nostalgia. Their two talents have fashioned a record that’s urgent, honest, and fun. Remember fun?

1474,Rod Melancon,"Like the soundtrack to a movie that doesn’t yet exist, Rod Melancon’s Pinkville whips up a world filled with shellshocked war veterans, gun-wielding rock & rollers, and other down-on-their-luck characters, mixing cinematic details and electric guitars into its own version of greasy, gothic Americana.
Pulling everything together is Melancon himself: a southern songwriter and storyteller rooted in the oral tradition of Cormac McCarthy and Larry Brown. His songs are dark and detailed, and his voice — which veers between a spoken-word delivery, a croon, and a rough-edged howl — is every bit as diverse as the material it delivers. Pinkville, his fourth release, makes plenty of room for that diversity. There are psychedelic soul songs, Rolling Stones-inspired rockers, tributes to icons like Freddy Fender and Tom Petty, and a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “57 Channels (And Nothin’ On),” all captured in analog sound by co-producers Adrian Quesada and Will Walden.

1482,Rose Droll,"Welcome to the world of Rose Droll’s debut album, one that mystifies people trying to compare it to anything else. It challenges conventions, knocking you on your ass with some glitchy electronics here or a blown-out scream there when you least expect it. It’s a captivating listen from the San Francisco-based artist, one that rewards multiple listens and a close reading of the lyric sheet.

The resulting album, self-recorded and self-produced in a duplex in LA’s Highland Park and a quiet cabin in Big Bear, is a collection of ten diverse tracks spanning the last three years. She played every instrument on the record, including guitar, piano, drums, bass, cello, and glockenspiel.

The songs tell a meticulous and complex story, detailing the joy and despair following the inception and drawn-out end of various romantic connections and her division from Christianity. The songs all have one major thing in common: the commitment to honesty, often telling these stories exactly as they happened.

Your Dog, released on 11/16 via Father/Daughter and Double Denim, will linger in your brain for weeks, giving you a rare glimpse into the life of one of the most stunning new talents around.

A celebratory effort ushering in a new era for the band, after having recently evolved from a sextet to a trio, “MCH: Part One” is about finding hope in transition, discovering your voice in a sea of doubt, and deciding to dance despite sadness. Since the departure of three founding band members in 2016, Run River North have fought to reclaim their identity and their sound. With that came a reckoning: The trio were steadfast on returning to their roots and rebranding again as Monsters Calling Home as a way to separate themselves from the personnel changes.“Having to go through three breakups, it was a shitty time,” Hwang says. “The EP song are more representative of how do you find hope and how do you find joy even if you have a right to feel angry. How can you find a reason to dance even when everyone is telling you it’s not the right time to dance?”

With a support system of Atlanta music veterans, including DJ Holiday and The Commission, Richy has a solid foundation today, but this wasn’t always the case. Richy began freestyling in school at a young age, noticeably outshining the competition. “Music has always been in my blood,” he says, “but it wasn’t until later I thought about being an artist.” In his early rap career, Richy was known as Snipe in the group Murder Mafia, which later renamed to Born With It. He soon learned it wasn’t as easy as it looked. “Unfortunately, these same peers never took me serious because I was always getting locked up,” he admitted.
Being in and out of jail wiped away several prime opportunities. B.o.B. was featured on the Born Wit It record “Stack Your Paper” produced by DJ Toomp.

Incorporating dissonance into traditional song structures, Russian Baths aesthetic recalls Big Black’s caustic fits, ’70s space rock, Chapel Hill’s noise pop, Big Muff driven grunge, and the angular arrangements of British post-punk. The breadth of Russian Bath’s scope in sound is marked by the distance and cohesion between singles in the furious, driving “Slenderman” and the elegant thunderstorm that is “Poolhouse.”

1497,Saint Lo,"Saint Lo. is a Montreal-based folk, indie, pop rock band with roots that stretch across the continent. Their songs are nuanced and layered featuring hypnotic vocals, profound lyrics, and incredible harmonies. They sing about complex emotions – vulnerability, isolation, connection, nostalgia and loss – always infused with more than just a hint of hope. Their new album ‘We Could Be’ is a thematic tour-de-force. The first video single from the record, titled ‘Wounds’, is a stunning ode to the way that heartbreak does not occur in isolation.

1498,Saint Pé,"In 2014, after 10 years of touring the world (literally every continent but Antarctica!) in Atlanta’s legendary Black Lips as well as the critically-acclaimed Diamond Rugs, guitarist and vocalist Ian Saint Pé needed a change. As he put it, “The only thing you can’t change is time, So it was time that changed me. I loved the Black Lips, but I needed to enjoy new environments. So I got a brand new bag: Saint Pé.“ 
He packed up his gear and moved to Nashville, where he settled down in a log cabin formerly owned by country legend Roy Acuff. Before long, that home had also turned into a studio, and with the help of a number of Atlanta-based friends, Fixed Focus was born. It’s less a departure from the sounds of the Lips and Rugs as it is an informed continuation of them that maintains all the hooks and pop sensibilities of his previous acts, while refining them with a bit of Nashville class and a hint of the darkness that 10 years on the road imbues upon the soul. 
From singalong stompers ”Street Lights,“ ”Got The Look“ and ”Kiss It Goodbye“ to Southern Gothic explorations like ”Burning Bright“ and ”Carbon Maker,“ Fixed Focus is a fully-formed solo debut.

A big helping of attitude, a willingness to experiment and a knack for writing rousing choruses ensures they make enough noise to rival a full band, and they're not afraid to get real in their lyrics.
With only three songs out at the time, attention soon came to the brothers as their second track 'King' was being played on US radio and they received a call from the Imagine Dragons manager asking them to support in London.
Since then, Saint PHNX have been able to hone their craft; they played across the country as festivals like Reading & Leeds and V Festival and embarked on their own headline tour in September 2017. In the short year that Saint PHNX has existed, many goals have already been achieved, and it's their brotherly bond that's spurred their whirlwind career forward.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Rock,Pop,"Glasgow, UK-ENGLAND","Mar 13, 2019",2:10pm-2:40pm,British Music Embassy @ Latitude 30,False
1503,Samia,"Every song from New York City’s Samia shows a poet’s gift for capturing the most private of experiences, a gritty specificity that leaves her lyrics carved right onto your heart. Her ballads recall a low-lit charm and her rock songs rev and howl with intensity. But whether the volume is up or down, Samia draws from the same well of sharp-witted lyricism as forebears old and new —from Patti Smith to Liz Phair to Josh Tillman.
Now with her new double A-side single “Lasting Friend”/“Paris,” Samia further proves her profound skill at transforming painful or ugly or entirely ordinary moments into something transcendent. The gloriously scrappy yet strangely tender “Lasting Friend” finds Samia building an unlikely anthem out of a complicated high school memory. “I have this party anecdote about how the boys in middle school used to line up in the gym and touch my boobs,” she recalls. “It's as funny as it is difficult for me to grapple with, because it's how I learned to measure my worth. I made a lot of friends thatway and it's hard to unlearn that routine; we were all trying to make sense of the roles we were assigned.”

1507,San Mei,"San Mei AKA Emily Hamilton began her musical journey at the keys of her family piano, a consequence of a love ingrained and inherited from her dad’s favourite Beatles records and penchant for classic 60’s pop.
San Mei is enamored with the transportative nature of music, her guitar heavy, delay ridden, dreamy pop explores the hyper-blaze of existence and the intricacies of the in between.
Family and home have always been integral to Hamilton’s creative process. The daughter of Chinese-Malaysian and New Zealand born parents, her family immigrated to Australia at an early age. 
Her parents, resilient and sacrificial, nurtured and encouraged her creatively, instilling in her a gift that she would lean on heavily to help diffuse and navigate the chaos of growing up and forging her identity. Using art as therapy, her songs became a conduit for escape and to shoulder the loss of her mother. 
Armed with just a MIDI-keyboard and a Macbook San Mei was born. Her DIY project quickly gained groundswell and nods from national tastemakers Triple J, and further afield from heavy weights NME and NYLON.
The DNA of her creativity and pop-influencers matured, taking tips from her guitar driven he

1508,San Saba County,"San Saba County began as a straight garage-country group that could only come from Austin, Texas: equally comfortable playing the Continental Club and 30-something house parties with angular po-mo groups with Romulan haircuts.  Singer John Saba and his Dallas Jesuit high school classmate, Chris Wellington, wedded the unshakable, rhythm of Idahoans Tom Hudson and Tyler Mallory (Silver Scooter).  And, over the course of nearly a decade, the band has truly found their sound. 
This year band will release its sixth album, “Sub Rosa” (release date May 2019).  This album is forged from 1960's Texas garage-rock, cosmic-country, R.E.M, and the multitude of music that followed in their sneaker prints.  It's music for people who don't care about genres anymore, so long as the guitars are loud.
""Fifth,"" (2016) was well-received, described as “ghostly anthemic” and deserving of “the same national audience that Okkervil River and Shearwater enjoy.”  -Austin Chronicle.  
Through it all, are the songs – honest, witty, and well-crafted.  But, like the band’s predecessors, the essence will always be remembered sounding best as performed jumping off the hardwood floors of an East Austin crash pad.

1509,Sarah Bethe Nelson,"Sarah Bethe Nelson is the constant observer. Having spent the better part of her adult life tending bar at San Francisco’s most well-loved watering holes, she has witnessed thousands of late nights fights, early morning rants, blackouts, make-outs, and make-ups. Yet she seems to have an eye cast askance at the streetlights outside. For it’s not the drama unfolding inside the bar that keeps her rapt; it’s the possibility that one night a light will appear outside, a glowing orb with all the answers that she can levitate into, that will rescue her from love-worn ennui, from the violence of misspent youth. What stands out about the songs on her Burger Records debut Fast-Moving Clouds is this sense of waiting, waiting, hoping.
Ms. Nelson doesn’t exude the brassy confidence of a chanteuse; nor does she wear the mask of false naivete favored by some of her “indy” musical contemporaries. Rather, Nelson and her plaintive, unforced voice seem to hang in the balance, and the source of her songs seems a mix of genuine heartbreak and stark resolve. Her music is reflected in that not-extreme dichotomy; in it there is warmth and beauty, as well as a genuine mean streak, softened barely by her we

1510,Sarah Shook & the Disarmers,"North Carolina’s Sarah Shook sings with a conviction and hard honesty sorely lacking in much of today’s Americana landscape. Always passionate, at times profane, Sarah stalks/walks the line between vulnerable and menacing, her voice strong and uneasy, country classic but with contemporary, earthy tension. You can hear in her voice what’s she’s seen; world weary, lessons learned—or not—but always defiant. She level-steady means what she says. Writing with a blunt urgency—so refreshing these days it's almost startling—Sarah's lyrics are in turn smart, funny, mean, and above all, uncompromising. Sly turns of phrase so spot on they feel as old and true as a hymn. Anger that's as confrontational as it is concise. Humor that's as wry and resigned as a park bench prophet. 
The Disarmers hit all the sweet spots from Nashville’s Lower Broad to Bakersfield and take Sarah's unflinching tales out for some late-night kicks. At times, it’s as simple and muscular as Luther Perkins’ boom-chicka-boom, or as downtown as Johnny Thunders. The Disarmers keep in the pocket, tight and tough.

Those that have followed SaulPaul's career know that you never know what to expect. He headlined the Kiddie Stage both weekends at ACL. But he also officially showcased at the Folk Alliance Festival. He could drop a folk album or a trap album. (He's done both.) When asked why he is so diverse, in his southern accent he replies, ""Because that's what true to me. I'm just doing me. I'm from the trap. And I play guitar & sing. It makes sense in my mind.""
SaulPaul is unique. And his collaborations are too. He has worked with artists from around the world. His most recent collaboration is with Latin Grammy winning artist, 123 Andrés for SaulPaul’s song, Home, which is featured on SaulPaul’s album, All Star Anthems.
As the saying goes, ""He started from the bottom and now he's here."" But the question is...Where's he headed next?

is fast establishing himself as an authentic original, Americana artist with an old soul. His deep,
beyond-his-years lyrics and melodies, raw, soulful vocals, and powerful live performances have attracted
an ever-growing number of devoted fans of all ages, selling out shows throughout the US.
As a folk/blues singer-songwriter, who cut his teeth at local farmers markets, open mics, and iconic New
York venues like Caffe Lena, the Towne Crier Cafe, and The Bitter End, Sawyer seemed an unlikely
match for reality tv, but quickly won over broad audiences with his genuine delivery and unique
arrangements of classic songs, going on to win season 8 of NBC's The Voice.
In 2018, Sawyer once again went independent, reclaiming full artistic control, creating an album entirely
written by Sawyer, self-produced and self-released. The highly-anticipated Hide Your Ghost sheds the
high gloss major label treatment, and stays true to Frederick’s honest and elegantly stripped down style, a
self-described “free range folk”, incorporating elements of blues, roots rock, and jazz.

Employing a highly-visual lyrical panache and an atypically full-throated singing style, Barna’s newest record, Cissy, a gasping, rapid-fire deconstruction of what it means to be a man. If Bukowski was queer and wrote songs for Patti Smith, those songs might sound like this.
Camped out in 1809 Studios, a literal stone’s throw from the Erie Canal, Seán and producer/studio owner Dave Drago set out to make a record, start to finish, in a few days, later adding a collaboration from Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows.
Cissy is a measured, brutally observant deconstruction of masculinity, where the main players in the story – drag queens, mothers, queers, office workers, and wanderers – come together in the name of excess and anxiety. Barna plays both drums and guitar on Cissy, but it is his rare poetic bravado and stream-of-consciousness vocal delivery – theatrical and pained but grounded and honest – that guides us, shines a light on our traumas, and invites us in for a drink.

From guitars and tambourines come in clear, vocals like moans drenched in reverb and other effects decorated with the sound of running water and cavernous trumpet, to sometimes an idiosyncratic collision of lo-fi psych pop and aggressively dark electronic postpunk, that's only a little taste of what you can find in his seven years trajectory. There’s something bright and relaxing to it, but at the same time spooky and haunting. 
He has played in venues like Primavera Sound, Vida Festival, FIM Vila-Seca, Tbilisi Open Air, Canal+Menú Stereo, Sofar Sounds, Balcony TV...
He counts with two great EPs “The River” and “AHÁ”: especially this last one where Miles Raymer's article written for Noisey refered to it as ""a bunch of songs that were as unexpectedly weird as they were unexpectedly good"" and ""easy to find yourself putting on repeat"".
As well as his debut LP “Bit Kong” recorded two years later, Nika finally released his second album “Ellipsis” in January of 2018 and now he is cooking something new for this March 2019.

1540,Shady Bug,"Shady Bug don’t just utilize contrast, they revel in it. Lemon Lime, the St. Louis four-piece’s appropriately titled sophomore full-length, is a sweet and sharp sonic confection, each song a push and pull of jagged distortion and rich melodies. The album finds Shady Bug--comprised of guitarist/vocalist Hannah Rainey, guitarist Tom Krenning, drummer Aaron O’Neill, and bassist Chris Chartrand (Todd Anderson plays bass the on this recording)--twisting their brand of noisy, dynamic guitar pop into new directions.
Building on the promise of their 2017 debut, tbh idk, Lemon Lime further sharpens Shady Bug’s sound. “Make It Up” opens the album with a wall of explosive fuzz that barely gives the listener time to acclimate before shifting gears to a shimmering verse of interwoven guitars and Rainey’s warm voice. Her uniquely phrased melodies set the stage for the Lemon Lime’s lyrical explorations of late night hangouts, existential angst, and the poignancy of mundane moments—like the reference to sharing a can of Sprite that lends the record its’ title.

The support of Izzo - known for launching the careers of Gucci Mane, Future, and Young Thug - has allowed Shah to flourish despite rejecting major label deals, as he looks to become rap's first truly independent international superstar.

The art-rock masterpiece encases the band’s vulnerable wisdom in flighty melodies that burn with intimacy and fragility as singer/lyricists Jonathan Merenivitch and Adrian Benedykt Świtoń address everything from toxic masculinity and Catholic guilt to Youtube comments and Tupac Shakur. Since their 2011 EP ​Holy Stain,​ the band have received accolades for their taut analyses of social ills and the resulting strain on body and mind, but even the skeletal no-wave that defined their early sound was bound with, in the broadest sense of the word, soul. The band’s ability to confront their deepest insecurities and doubts is more than simple catharsis, it serves to illuminate deeper questions of existence and identity, and frame them in context of systemic oppression, discrimination, and isolation. The band's expansive new LP ""Insignificant Whip"" will be released on Arrowhawk Records in 2019

songwriter Shirazee found himself in Atlanta with nothing but trialing experiences and a dream of
fracturing the juggernaut that is the rap industry. Though vitally settled in the city that bled rap
music, a new path would take shape that would soon define his career. That path was
songwriting. Though ingrained in his DNA through countless years of artistry, surrendering the
pen to the needs of other artists was uncharted territory. This soon led to his departure from the
city that represented what seemed like his lifelong dream to the city that sculpts, chisels and
molds it. While opportunity was deep-seated in the concrete arms of the rigorous goliath, New
York tested Shirazee’s resilience. Overcoming homelessness he soon signed his first publishing
deal and found himself at the helm of songs by artists like Sting, Afrojack, Ty Dolla $ign, and
more. Fast forward to 2018 and
encompassing experience, influence and his widespread musical pallet, Shirazee releases
“MAKE WILD”, a feel-great tune that calls for intentness in what has always been his
foreordained playground.

Since then, Shorty has become paramount to the crew’s live performances, actively wrecking sound systems with his definitive flow. This came to a head during 2014’s Red Bull Culture Clash between A$AP Mob, Rebel Sound, Stone Love and Boy Better Know where, despite clamorous disapproval from the crowd, Rebel Sound took the crown over BBK. Many believe the decision was wrong, and Shorty’s bars on the night were a big part of that.
Largely shunning the limelight, Shorty has remained perhaps BBK’s most humble spokesperson, for the most part uninterested in the big business gluttony of the mainstream and driven purely by grime’s infamous DIY spirit.

After landing a deal with the Chicago based Wax Trax Records, through an introduction from his Revolting Cocks cohort and Ministry’s main man Al Jourgensen, Phildo penned the now classic song “Chemical Imbalance.” Years of reckless abandon would result later signing with Megaforce Records, known for their connection to breaking Metallica, a classic episode of “Beavis and Butthead,” video plays on MTV’s Headbangers Ball, several successful tours with Ministry, KMFDM, GWAR, FEAR etc. and a failed European tour with TOOL which brought the band to a break up that would later be revived by Phildo. 2016 brought the release of the band’s most current album “Adult Entertainment for Kids” which fe

1578,SLEEPWALKERS,"It’s easy to claim that certain musicians live and breath the music they love, but rarely will you find a group as versed and versatile as Sleepwalkers. The band grew out of the partnership between Richmond-based brothers Michael and Austin York, who were raised by a soul- and funk-loving mother and a father who was partial to rock. Listening. Internalizing. Developing an uncanny understanding of what makes music from different eras great, and how to synthesize it to make something new and precise. Sleepwalkers was formed when the brothers met drummer Alex DeJong. The group’s first show took place in November of 2013, and they’ve since shared stages with The Shins and Matthew E. White, crisscrossed the country in a Lincoln Towncar as part of The Lumineers headlining bill and joined numerous bills with J. Roddy Walston & The Business, who have served as mentors and frequent onstage collaborators. Their on-stage dynamism is a natural extension of the core trio’s studio work, which is entirely self-engineered and produced.

Consisting of Danish-American brothers Jakob and Oliver Mueller and their childhood friend David Dugan, the band solidified in 2014 after a decade of high school bands came to an end.

1583,The Small Glories,"Roots powerhouse duo The Small Glories are Cara Luft & JD Edwards, a musical tour-de-force partnership planted on the Canadian Prairies.  Thrown together purely by accident for an anniversary show at Winnipeg’s venerable West End Cultural Centre, The Small Glories is a partnership that could almost make you believe in fate.  With a stage banter striking a unique balance between slapstick and sermon, these veteran singer-songwriters have a way of making time disappear, rooms shrink, and audiences feel as they are right there on the stage with the band.  It’s not uncommon for listeners to find themselves laughing, dancing, crying, or caught up in a good ol’ fashioned sing-along.  Their material is rootsily welcoming — songs of love, loss, & environment, delivered with soaring, interwoven vocals on various combinations of stomping clawhammer banjo & guitar. The two have an innate chemistry  — a chemistry labeled the “Lennon-McCartney syndrome,” by Americana UK, writing, “Some things just work together… to witness a performance by TSG is a rare opportunity to experience that indefinable quality that creates perfection.”

Their interest in the jazz standards of the swing-era shine through in their voices, writing, and playing, while their ear for new sounds and ideas constantly drives them forward. The product of this pairing is what Insider Louisville has called “a mad science blend of western swing, hot jazz and folk,” which is “already starting to gel into something wholly singular.” 
The band have recently released their third collection, Too Big To Fail, which has received positive feedback from listeners and critics alike. Laura Shine, Assistant Program Director/On-Air Host at Louisville WFPK, says of the band: “Small Time Napoleon is poised for big time things. They are truly one of the most unique and exciting bands I’ve seen come out of Louisville in a very long time. Their music and instrumentation and vocals are exquisite!”

The band is fronted by singer, guitarist and producer Jake Miles. Annie Long and Mary Bryce fortify the outfit with stunning vocal harmonies, and provide a spectacle at live shows with matching alien-esque attire and singular dance moves. Other members include Harrison Anderson on the bass and Everett Bergstedt on the drums. “Sunny dissonance, avant garde pop, and playful instrumentation inform SMiiLE’s warm sincerity,” says The Austin Chronicle. Instrumentally, SMiiLE is notably polyrhythmic and complex, but with a pop influenced buoyancy that satiates.

Husband and wife duo Ryan Devlin and Kim West first met while slinging pies at a south Seattle restaurant in their early 20s. Devlin, a fixture in the Northwest’s thriving DIY rock scene, and West, an aspiring law student, started writing and recording songs in Devlin’s bedroom during a cash-strapped Christmas as their friendship blossomed into romance. Pulling from their mutual love of 70s rock, vintage synthesizers, thrift shop treasures, and early MTV, the pair’s bond permeated their pop songcraft. The duo,  joined by drummer Nick Krivchenia and bassist Luke Logan, create a stoney blend of Northwest rock & roll and razor-sharp disco grooves that Impose Magazine has called “a modern bit of AM radio gold.”
The group released their first LP, Taste For Blood, in 2014 to regional acclaim and heavy airplay and support from iconic radio station KEXP. Catching the attention of upstart label Freakout Records, the band released their sophomore LP, Hot Candy, in 2016. 2018 saw the band releasing two EP's, ""Come to Terms"" and ""Different Windows,"" with supporting appearances at clubs and festivals across the United States and the UK.

1589,Sneaks,"Just as she takes up space in the male-dominated Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area punk scene, Sneaks aka Eva Moolchan takes up space among the patriarchy. Highway Hypnosis, her forthcoming album on Merge Records that will drop in January, plays on hip-hop, post-punk, and invented words to fill a gap between the feminist underground and genre-specific singles charts. Through it, Moolchan joins the resistance forged by queer black feminists who create, explore, empower, conquer, and play bass.
The solo act, born with Pluto in Scorpio, released her first single “Beliefs” in September. The glimmering anthem shrouded in an atmosphere of darkness drops its beat along with a call to arms for all non-believers whose mantra is assigned: “Remove your beliefs and start again / ’cause all I wanna do is start again.” 
Flashes of Robyn, Britney Spears, Jock Jams, Nirvana, recess hour on the blacktop, M.I.A., Lil Mama, a hacky sack circle, Aaliyah, and your first Warped Tour experience somehow all make sense inside the mind attached to ears experiencing Highway Hypnosis.

Using her kaleidoscopic array of skills, a seemingly limitless imagination and a touch of magic, she is the only person in the world that interactively weaves lyrics, melodies and chords into coherent stories and whole compositions on the spot. All the songs are completely improvised, sound like radio songs and she can deliver them in seven languages! Blessed with a 4 octave vocal range and an angelic voice, she sings on festival stages and at intimate gatherings, where her ability to tune in with the crowd leaves people both floored and deeply inspired. All this comes with some great profundity yet with a sense of whimsy and fun too. The basic idea: a life improvised, is a life well lived and demystifies creation as being exclusive and complicated.
Lex performs with amazing musicians from all over the world, who also improvise everything they play and she mostly meets just before a show. Lex Empress is a fascinating artist that defy any category or description, always congenially accessible yet never failing to mesmerise the listener.

In the years since, the music transformed into a blend of delicate dissonance, distorted slide guitar transmissions, sequenced beats, vinyl samples and warm electronics, culminating in the April debut of SONTALK: Act I EP on Sony Music Masterworks. Initially meant as an introduction to his full-length debut, the EP’s lead single “I Am a War Machine” garnered praise right out of the gate as Stereogum claimed, “LeMay sounds vulnerable, but the sunny thumping instrumentation delivers enough momentum to aid in a kind of soul-saving atonement.”As he took the project on the road, the track generated over a million streams within a few months.

The New York singer and songwriter leverages the freedom to soulfully speak her mind and share truths by way of vivid songwriting cast over swaths of lush acoustic guitars and dense piano chords.
Between ceaseless touring, 2016 saw her achieve the grand prize at The John Lennon Songwriting Contest, while Cosmopolitan Magazine named her “Singer of the Year” in Spain where she also graced the publication’s cover. Along the way, she penned what would become her third full- length album and first release for BMG, Next Time.

Next Time will be released through BMG, March 15th 2019.

Whether entirely traditional or a contemporary fusion of notes, instruments, movement and meditation, Soriah’s offerings convey his reverence for the mystery of existence.

Welcome to Sorry Girls.
Easier – their new 7” / double single – presents a culmination in Sorry Girls’ sound. Equally steeped in lament and celebration, its two songs are driven by uplifting vocals and synth-heavy arrangements. Cruisin’ power pop that cries equally with joy and sorrow. All the pleasure and regret felt by a hypochondriac who can’t resist a good cigarette.
Sorry Girls is a Montreal based duo consisting of Heather Foster Kirkpatrick and Dylan Konrad Obront. The two met in 2008 while studying at university, making joke songs on GarageBand together over pots of Kraft Dinner on the floor of their friend’s apartment.

Authenticity can be heard in every note, but then it’s coming from the same source – not only musically and culturally, but even the same ghetto communities of West Kingston. Spiritual was raised in Allman Town, and sang in his local choir before embracing Rastafari. He was orphaned at an early age, and could have joined the throngs of young hopefuls at any number of studios and sound-systems scattered throughout the city. Instead, he shunned fame and helped to heal the broken society around him by counselling the poor and needy. Music was in his blood and he continued to write songs, but Rastafari was his true calling.

Spooky is 5 friends from SF and LA who came together by night in an old Surf Shop to rehearse and work out their unique mix of surf, soul, and rock n roll. They give raucous and rhythmically driven performances full of contagious good vibes and an overwhelming feeling that everything is totally 'Alright'. They've had opportunities to play with grammy award winning artists such as Cafe Tacuba and Natalia LaFourcade and play stages up and down the West Coast and through out the South West.

Subscribing to the belief that a gig should be a show not just a showcase, the band's commitment to spectacle has seen them sell out shows across the capital with their biggest yet to come as they prepare for a, in their own words, “Robbie-Williams-at-Knebworth” level of performance at the Scala in September.

Having originally uploaded their hilariously hillbillified but air-tightly played rendition of AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” on YouTube just for a laugh they found themselves in the receiving end of the shock of their lifetimes in the form of millions upon millions of viewers. They started to think there might actually be something here and ended up with a recording deal with Spinefarm Records. 
After dropping their debut Farm Machine (2015) the band played 175 shows, toured in 20 countries and a dozen US states, Mere 16 months removed from the debut, the country dropped the foundations-shaking sophomore album, Brothers In Farms. it conquered the #1 position on the BillBoard Bluegrass Albums chart in January of 2016. 
On their third outing, Grainsville, the Gulls’ musical evolution gets more risqué. Instead of just having fun and merriment non-stop, the songs feature influences from World Music, such as Mariachi horns, stomping Balkanite beats and some flashy fiddling. 
With another landmark album under their belt it’s time for the Gulls to tour again ‘til the wheels fall off the wagon!

1644,Stove,"For the better part of a decade guitarist/vocalist Steve Hartlett has been consistently churning out impeccable guitar music and amassing an impressive catalog of distortion-drenched cult classics while fronting college rock stalwarts Ovlov, as well as Stove — an endeavour that’s allowed Hartlett to explore a different side of all things catchy and fuzzed-out. Initially a solo project, Stove has bloomed into a full-fledged band with the additions of drummer/vocalist Jordyn Blakely, bassist Alex Molini, and guitarist Mike Hammond. Now on their sophomore LP, the cheekily titled ‘s Favorite Friend, the band has truly come into their own to make an album that defines Stove’s identity and captures the four member’s extraordinary musical chemistry, as well as the joy and relief that can come from creating together in the midst of challenging times.
Stove’s 2015 debut, Is Stupider, was an extension of Ovlov’s DNA, but Hartlett soon discovered that when separated from the sonic parameters and expectations of that band’s work, he felt free to try out different dynamics and sounds--an excitement that would grow along with Stove’s lineup during the writing and recording sessions that became

Their first album ‘Nevermind the Living Dead’ (2006) led to a tour of around one hundred rock festival dates ranging from ‘Eurockéennes de Belfort’, ‘les Vielles Charrues’ through ‘to Rock en Seine’. Their reputation was quickly established with the release of their second album,‘Shoegazing Kids’ (2009), which paved the way for a major international tour (France, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, Austria). With the album ‘Poursuit’ (2012), the band introduced a type of rock music that was less raw, with compositions better arranged and more diverse compositions. Finally,‘Survivor’ (2016) came along and the music of Stuck in the Sound fully assumed the mantle of pop, proffering a well-polished album. The quintet is currently getting ready for its big comeback with new releases coming soon.

1650,Stuyedeyed,"Irrepressible, loud, direct, fuzzed out — Stuyedeyed are an unhinged skull rattling atop a spine, snapping to intensity and directing your attention to our reality, right now. 
Originating in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Stuyedeyed (pronounced sty’d - eyed) cultivate an unfettered attitude in their music to embolden the disenfranchised to challenge the status quo. 
These songs speak to the experiences of singer and songwriter Nelson Antonio Hernandez-Espinal and are brought to life with bassist Humberto Genão, drummer Luis Ruelas, and guitarist George Ramirez. 
Broadcasting a riotous energy to the important dialogues of our time in a tumultuous yet carefully articulated sonic wave that emanates resilience. Stuyedeyed depicts the experiences of being young Latinxs in a “New York-for-some” bubble. With rhythm, aggression, conviction, and cut teeth, they slash through a thick curtain of anxiety and depravity with urgency. 
Their challenge is to expose vulnerability, to swim in it and understand that in those deep waters, there is comfort. And if anything they are there with you, in every recording and at every show. Their message is simple. “No one is cool. No one is important.”

1654,Sudakistan,"Regarded by many as ""the best live band in Sweden"", few bands can chalk up their signature musical style to the contrasts between their roots and their adopted hometown, but Sudakistan are one of them. The Stockholm five-piece announced their arrival on the punk scene proper in furious fashion with their incendiary debut record, Caballo Negro, by 2015; unsurprisingly for so an ambitious and irresistibly energetic album, it met with rave reviews across the board. What made it stand out from The crowd, though, was its interpolation of the band's backgrounds. Of Sudakistan's five members, only guitarist Arvid Sjöö is Swedish born-and-wide. The other  four  -  frontman  Michell  Serrano,  bassist  Maikel  Gonzalez,  percussionist  Carlos  Amigo  and  drummer  Juan  Jose  Espindola  -  all  hail  from  South  America  and  latin  musical  influences  are  a  key  part  of  their  sound,  particularly  in  terms  of  rhythm  and  groove;  lay  guitars  and  vocals  that  recall  the  likes  of  Oh  Sees,  At  the  Drive-In  and  Death  from  Above  over  the  top  of  that  and  you  have  a  potent  clash  of  styles  that  elevates  Sudakistan  above  their  peers.

1655,Sundrifter,"Born out of a Boston rock underground teeming with history and riffs alike, Sundrifter capture the essence of tonal weight with their Small Stone debut, Visitations. Their second album overall behind 2016’s Not Coming Back, the nine-track long-player harnesses spaciousness and heft alike and soars with melodic vibrancy in a way most acts simply can’t balance. Shades of Soundgarden and Queens of the Stone Age appear, but they’re just shades, and Sundrifter’s vision of heavy is their own, someplace between grunge, doom, psychedelia and classic heavy rock. 
Sundrifter is comprised of guitarist/vocalist Craig Puera, bassist Paul Gaughran and drummer Patrick Queenan, and Visitations was engineered, mixed and mastered by Dan Schwartz at Futura Productions in Roslindale, Massachusetts. The space the record captures isn’t of the Hawkwind, pulsating rhythm variety, but instead one that oozes with planetary motion, one that rolls along a chaotic cosmic path, not at all afraid to smash one asteroid off another before crashing to the surface, which, as we all know, is how life began in the first place.

Super Doppler plays music largely inspired by an appreciation of the great records of the 1960’s and 70’s, while still drawing from an eclectic mix of contemporary influences. Originally from Norfolk, Virginia, Super Doppler has been touring the country extensively since the release of their debut album ‘Moonlight Anthems’ in 2017, produced by Matthew E. White of Spacebomb Records. In late 2017 the band recorded the six tracks of what would become ‘The Super Secret Singles Club’, released monthly throughout 2018. 2019 finds Super Doppler back in the studio working on their second full-length album and ready to hit the road again.

They soon teamed up with guitarist Andres Villegas and percussionist Daniel Sanchez, and started rehearsing together during time away from their other projects. That core group developed the band’s unique sound, laying the foundation for what was to come. In 2016, gaitero and vocalist Jaime Ospina relocated from Colombia to Austin, where he met and instantly connected with the group.
The band’s success has been the outcome of organic growth and auspicious timing.  Notable sets such as the Austin City Limits Music Festival, Levitation, and KGSR’s Blues on the Green, have catapulted the group into the spotlight.

There is a sense of darkness. But I’m crisscrossing the country, and people are good and fun. There is a lot of beauty everywhere. I think not forgetting that is important.
Osborne is home in Charleston, South Carolina, reflecting on the personal journey and cultural climate that have led to Ever Since I Lost My Mind, the third record and label debut for his acclaimed project SUSTO. The album is a resounding triumph: a mix of new partnerships and collaborations with old friends, all anchored by Osborne’s perceptive songs that explore connection, loss, and transience––and the pain and joy each brings. 
“Ever Since I Lost My Mind is very personal. This collection of songs came together over the course of a couple of years, and they all represent different moments,” he says. “It felt cathartic writing all of them, and they were also all fun in different ways.”

1666,Suzan Köcher,"Suzan Köcher and her band are here to start the second chapter of their psychedelic journey that began with the magical debut album ""Moon Bordeaux"" which was rightly praised as one of a kind. For the second record the musicians are now even more focussed on their true strengths. Inspired by a trip to Prague they wrote a song cycle called Suprafon. To maintain their focus on record they flew all the way to Austin, Texas to record their new album that is both - a natural evolution and a brand new start. While the energy of the band lingered around the corner on ""Moon Bordeaux“ it is now in full flight on these new songs. Suzan Köcher‘s mystical Psychedelia is infused with beautiful melodies, biting guitars and reverberated synths. Shades of Krautrock, Psych-Folk and French Pop float through the new songs that are at once enthralling and loose. Through many live shows her and her band have developed a unique sound fueled by Suzan´s magical voice, haunting melodies, fearless experimentation and rusty musical instruments that colour their sound in all shades of withered glory. Let her take you on a trip to the nearest far away place.

Celebrated for their bruising and feedback-drenched live shows, as well as a knack for the perfect nagging hook, Table Scraps have fought their way to the top of the garage rock pile by conquering stages and refusing to compromise.
'Autonomy', the band's most recent LP, surfaced in February 2018 to widespread enthusiasm, earned plays on BBC 6 Music and Radio 1, and was picked up for release in the US by the legendary Burger Records. A huge European tour with stoner legends Monster Magnet (at the insistence of Dave Wyndorf himself) quickly brought Table Scraps to a new legion of continental headbangers.

1677,Taimane,"HAWAII’S FLAMENCO UKULELE VIRTUOSO
Songwriter & virtuoso, Taimane, is best known for her fierce and inventive style of playing the ukulele. Her attraction to the four-string island staple began at age 3, and by age 10, she regularly performed in public, busking in Waikiki every Friday night with her father holding down security duties and Waikiki Beach Boys (adults whose home & workplace was the beach) serving as her band. By age 13, Taimane landed a position in Don Ho’s show literally playing in the spotlight every week until Ho’s passing. Fast forward to today, and you have an artist who tours the world and has carved out a unique niche in music –merging a wide-array of genres, from Bach to rock, flamenco infernos to tribal hymns, summoning a seemingly limitless palette of emotions via an instrument previously viewed as restricted.

1680,Talos,"“A lot of this new record was written in transit,” says Eoin French, the Irish artist better known as Talos. “Being away from the safety of my home and my studio allowed me to create in a different way. It was a terrifying feeling sometimes, but it also really rewarding.”
While Talos will always be connected to his native Ireland, his stunning second LP, ‘Far Out Dust' - made with longtime production partner, Ross Dowling (James Vincent McMorrow, Bell X1) and a slew of collaborators including producers Doug Schadt (Maggie Rogers, Wet) and Valgeir Sigurðsson (Sigur Ros, Feist) and mixer Damian Taylor (Bjork, Arcade Fire) - draws on a wider perspective, melding tracks written and recorded in New York, Los Angeles, London, Dublin, Cork, and Reykjavik. 
The result is both French’s most confident songwriting and his most sophisticated studio work yet, an album that oscillates between hushed introspection and explosive ecstasy as it grapples with the pain of doubt and regret.

1686,TarantisT,"Formed in 2000 by a group of young underground metal heads, TARANTIST originated in the basement alternative rock and heavy metal scenes in their native Tehran, Iran. Having to perform secretly-but-loudly often proved to be difficult, but after sparking a following via word of mouth in the underground, the band soon began to garner international recognition. Within just a few years, international media correspondents inspired by their story (including BBC, SKY, CNN, NPR, Metal Hammer and Kerrang) started visiting Tehran to meet and talk with TARANTIST. These news reports and articles aided TARANTIST in cultivating a worldwide following – motivating the band to relocate to the United States Los Angeles in 2008.

Although remaining positive, TARANTIST quickly found that they weren’t able to fully escape the pressures they faced back home, stemming from “not being Muslim enough”. Once they arrived in the United States, they experienced opposite – uncomfortable stereotypes and assumptions directed at them simply based on their culture and/or how they looked – all the while never practicing religion in the first place. Determined, TARANTIST didn’t let this slow them down.

In the world she conjures within the album, there's plenty of room to forge your own home where you can rejuvenate and heal—where you don't have to be a superhero and you don't have to save the world all by yourself, where nothing is expected of you except that you just be. It's the kind of album you can curl into after a hot summer day in the city: a powerful talisman in a demanding world, and a reminder that kindness toward the self can help unlock the way to a world a little more livable than this one.

1691,Taylor Janzen,"“The powerful simplicity of a voice, a guitar, a restrained melody and a raw emotion has been rediscovered by songwriters like Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and now Taylor Janzen.” - The New York Times
Growing up, Taylor had a religious upbringing in Winnipeg, MT attending a small school up until graduation. Her family and friends never talked to one another about difficult things they were experiencing in life, and if they ever needed help, they turned to religion for answers.

Unable to talk through her issues in mental health, Taylor turned to songwriting as an outlet and, as a result, with each song on ""Interpersonal” we're granted an intimate and almost painstakingly brazen glimpse into the most heart wrenching pages of her diary. She writes candidly, “the music that I write is very honest, so it speaks for itself.”

“The thing is, my personality isn’t as depressing as my music is,” adds Taylor. Often tweeting about Dennis Quaid and the occasional Paramore cover (one of which went viral with 25k+ retweets and got the endorsement from Hayley Williams herself) every little thing Taylor shares with the world is magic, finding beauty in even the darkest mundane moments.

1693,TC Superstar,"TC Superstar is a collaborative performance group fronted by Connor McCampbell. McCampbell’s production style is rooted in modern bedroom pop, but alludes to 80’s synthwave (Depeche Mode, New Order) and late 70’s dance music (Chic, David Bowie). TC Superstar’s live set features high-energy dance performances choreographed by LB Flett, Emily DiFranco, Francis Rodriguez, and Yuriko Roby: all graduates of the dance program at The University of Texas at Austin. Performing musicians include Julio Correa, Mitchell Webb, and Aaron Chavez. 
	The band formed in September of 2017 with the release of Masc, an album about notions of masculinity. TC Superstar quickly became a staple of the Austin scene, gigging frequently around the Red River cultural arts district. 
	In April of 2018 the band released Heat Death, a conceptual EP about the environment, consumerism, and grieving for the eventual death of humankind. TC Superstar followed this release with two national tours. In January 2019 the band was nominated by the Austin Chronicle for “Best New Austin Band.”

1696,TEEN,"The band TEEN came together at the turn of the decade, but its members have known each other their whole lives. Teeny, Lizzie, and Katherine Lieberson are sisters. Although they grew up in a musically vibrant Halifax home—their father was the esteemed composer Peter Lieberson—their first band jelled once they all lived in New York.
Good Fruit, the band’s fourth and newest album, is its sharpest thesis yet. A meditation on life after love, it’s thematically the opposite of its predecessor, 2016’s Love Yes, which The Guardian praised as “reminiscent of…inventive late-70s to mid-80s pop groups.” Musically, though, Good Fruit is the logical evolution of Love Yes’ massive uptick in synth use and sticky-hot choruses. The album boasts self-assured, skyrocketing synthpop anthems including “Only Water” and “Runner,” which betray the crucial lessons the sisters took from experiencing the distinct, enlivening ways that their myriad Love Yes tourmates employed synths. As with all TEEN albums, there are haunting ballads, most notably “Pretend,” which swells into a roaring synthetic climax as it details a relationship’s failure, a bold statement on moving forward and letting go of the past.

Their creative process is a fluid amalgam of influences spanning from The Symbolists, The Viennese Actionists, what the band describes as “Romantic Essentialism”, and various proto- and post- punk artists from within and outside the main currents of their genres. It’s no small miracle that Terminal A manage to leverage this heady creative bedrock and still deliver emotionally penetrative jams that aim for the gut and the groin, that are still undeniably rock and roll in nature."" - Arjun Rey, Sovo Mag

Then, in late 2016, the bladee collaborative album ’AvP’ dropped - clearly marking that through all the trials and tribulations, Thaiboy had continued to grow, constantly looking to evolve and find new ways of expression in order to escape this daily struggles.

Known for his stunning voice, in the mid-1960s the Jonesville, Louisiana native found himself racing up the Billboard charts, appearing on Dick Clark’s television shows, and performing all over the US and UK on package tours with everyone from Otis Redding to The Yardbirds.
As a songwriter, Tommy's first successes came from penning #1 hit singles for Freddy Fender on Huey Meaux's legendary Krazy Kajun label out of Houston, Tx.
In 2018, Tommy shared with his protege and producer C.C. Adcock, a new batch of original songs that he has (quietly) crafted over the last several years. Remarkably, they are the most powerful and deeply moving of his repertoire to date.
At 78 years of age, Tommy McLain is possibly the last great artist from the pioneer rock n' roll generation left to be rediscovered. His many talents and stage charisma remain completely intact and untarnished after a lifetime spent on bandstands back along the bayous of his home. His story unlocks the history of swamp pop and is a mainline into what is unique about Louisiana music.

This manifests itself through original productions for home listening and live DJ sets. 
Blending frequencies can have harmonic and discordant effects depending on how applied. The basis of my musical theory is to challenge listeners and delight attentive ears.
Taking historical context and user friendliness into account my music seeks to push the envelope while retaining mutated elements of familiarity and history.

With support already from from the likes of Gorilla vs Bear, XLR8R and Stereogum, their appearances at SxSW will be their first in the US. Like all good projects, this one started with a manifesto. “Let’s aim small and let it be big,” the pair wrote in a lengthy document guiding the recording process of debut album First Body, out via Liberation Records (Vance Joy, Julia Jacklin) and Terrible Records (Solange, Blood Orange) January 2019. Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly sure what kind of music would come out of those early sessions in 2015, but they were clear on how they wanted to do things. Their art would be sustainable, long-term, and almost entirely self-made. It’d be guided by bold visual cues, DIY principles, and artists that emphasise the empty space between notes as much as the notes themselves; artists such as James Blake, Caribou, and Jamie xx. “The music, above all else has to move you, physically and emotionally,” they wrote. And it does.

Dedicated to performing like her life depended on it, Lauren’s music career took her from DIY shows, to Ume playing major festivals like ACL and Paris' Rock En Seine and appearing on Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations. 
After taking a break to start a family, Lauren and bassist Eric Larson teamed with powerhouse drummer Aaron Perez and Grammy-winning engineer Stuart Sikes (Loretta Lynn, Cat Power) to reawaken the band. The acclaimed and triumphant result 'Other Nature' was released on Modern Outsider in 2018.

as an acoustic duo by childhood friends Kyle Morris and Cole Male in 2008. Eventually
expanding the lineup to include guitarist Brenton Carney, bassist Jared Hornbeek, and drummer

Feet. In early 2016, the Unlikely Candidates returned with a hooky new single in “You Love

1776,The Upside Down,"The Upside Down, an indie band coming from Chongqing, was formed in 2016. It includes 4 members. Their first album was released on May 7, 2017.
As some music magazines in China said, the first album of The Upside Down with diligent producing and serious attitude is so rare in this impetuous world. They’re wandering through varied music elements, with exquisite and Orphean arrangements and literary lyrics. The magical melody would hover over your mind in a casual moment，making you flow through a pure dream, romantic melancholia, and calm thoughts.
As a young band formed less than 2 years, The Upside Down has already appeared on many stages, such as Inmusic Festival, Changjiang International Music Festival, Nuart Festival, and Candy Mountain International Art & Music Festival… and was invited to perform at Apple Store in Apple x Beats activity. Their first album becomes a hit one in some music platform after releasing, and was recommended by Apple Music, QQ Music, Xiami Music, Baidu Music, and Street Voice… and was invited to record a TV show which called China’s Top Band.

The band consists of Margarida Falcão (vocals, keyboards), who is also a member of folk duo Golden Slumbers and a Xinobi (producer and dj) collaborator, Ricardo Nagy (guitar, beats, production) and Luís Monteiro (bass, beats).

1780,Vacationer,"The third full-length from Vacationer, Mindset is built on delicate melodies and crystalline rhythms that seem to alter the very texture of the world around you. Ornately composed but breezy in energy, Vacationer’s warm-hearted dream-pop perfectly mirrors frontman Ken Vasoli’s intentions in making the album. “The objective was to write songs that remind me how my brain needs to operate for my own wellbeing and happiness,” Vasoli says. “That’s where the title comes from—the record’s filled with all these reminders that put me in a good mindset for the day.”
Despite its often-euphoric effect, Mindset began in frustration for Vasoli. After countless false starts on the follow-up to 2014’s Relief, the Philadelphia-based musician decided to completely upend his creative approach. While Vacationer’s previous albums came to life in close collaboration with fellow members Matthew Young and Grant Wheeler, Vasoli shifted his focus from songwriting to production and worked entirely on his own for months on end. During that time, he immersed himself in exploring the nuances of Ableton and analyzing the construction of beloved albums by artists like the Beach Boys, Barry White, and Curtis Mayf

They’ve been steadily building up a fanbase worldwide completely on their own terms and through the internet with a unique blend of indie rock, jazz, and shoe-gaze. 
VACATIONS released their debut album ‘Changes’ last year in March. A bittersweet and nostalgic mix of arrangements, ‘Changes’ is multi-layered and rich work recorded almost entirely from home, before the neighbours complained and they had to shift the last of recording to a nearby studio. ‘Changes’ separates them from their contemporaries and highlights their development on all fronts from earlier releases like Vibes and Days.
VACATIONS show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. With more touring worldwide and new material on the horizon, it’s early days in this band’s career.

1783,Valley Maker,"Valley Maker is the songwriting project of South Carolina-bred, Seattle-based musician and PhD student in Human Geography, Austin Crane. His new album, Rhododendron, was released October 12 on Frenchkiss Records. This new record reflects both the rootedness and rootlessness that shapes Crane's songwriting on the precipice of his third decade. Named for the common plant which springs up in both Crane’s native south and his current home in Washington, Rhododendron is an album about transition, about leaving, but also arriving, a document of the journeys in-between. 
The album was recorded between two locales. In Portland, OR, Crane teamed with producer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Longtime friends and schoolmates from the University of South Carolina, Bear and Crane laid the groundwork for the record, playing all instruments in tracking four songs between themselves. The rest of the record was tracked in Seattle with producer Trevor Spencer (Father John Misty, Fleet Foxes), enlisting drummer James Barone (Beach House, Tennis) and bassist Eli Thomson (Father John Misty) and longtime collaborator Amy Fitchette to round out Rhododendron's lush but spacious sound.

Fiercely proud of their homeland, Vandoliers put their own spin on the Texas country tradition with 2016's Ameri-Kinda, a debut album that mixed honky-tonk twang with hard-edged, rock & roll stomp. The band's follow-up release, The Native, arrives less than one year, doubling down on Vandoliers' modern approach to traditional influences. Rounded out by bassist Mark Moncrieff, drummer Guyton Sanders, fiddler Travis Curry, electric guitarist Dustin Fleming, and multi-instrumentalist Cory Graves, the group fills The Native's 10 songs with barreling guitar solos, train beats, anthemic melodies, mariachi horns, and the autobiographical details of Fleming's own travels.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.",Alt Country,Americana,"Dallas, TX","Mar 13, 2019",9:00pm-9:40pm,Continental Club,False

Their popularity quickly burgeoned to the point where they found their fans singing along word-for-word to their first hits like “Georgia Fire” and “Shaky Hands.” 
With a sound reminiscent of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers mixed with the grit and twang of the Allman Brothers Band, The Vegabonds deliver a sensational performance, with powerhouse guitar riffs and impactful songwriting, night after night. From Ole Miss to South Carolina, students were buzzing about The Vegabonds’ authentic sound and their seemingly effortless ability to bring the house down. The group’s fan base rapidly grew and the guys learned there was something distinctive to their eclectic mix of Southern Rock, Country, and earnest songwriting. They kick off 2019 with the release of their fifth album (and first for Blue Élan Records) ""V"". Produced by Tom Tapley (Blackberry Smoke, Mastodon) “V” audibly illustrates the band’s unconventional yet contagious brand of Southern rock and highlights the best of The Vegabonds’ unique musicianship, vocals, lyrics and sound.

1790,Viagra Boys,"Grimey, acid highway full throttle; Viagra Boys twisted dark punk album ‘Street Worms’ is an interesting ride as vocalist Sebastian Murphy lets you ride shotgun while this trip takes you blazing to the top of a mountain before speeding right back down to the basement again. The bass line ferociously drives the car and the drums make sure you stay on the road - this is one of those trips where you sporadically wake up and find yourself in strange situations, wondering how the f*ck you got there.
From the Shrimp shack to the dog show, one minute you’re playing rugby ball the next moment you’re being eaten by worms, and between the fading lights and the strange look on your friend’s face Murphy grabs your ears and asks you what it really is you want from this life.
This is an album about illusions of realness, the absurdum of existence and the joke on humanity.
‘Street Worms’ is Viagra Boys debut studio album, a debut that instantly let them occupy their absolute own space in music history.

1794,Vince Ash,"Your favorite rap will always be low-budget and high stakes. Grainy videos with grimy flows. The stuff that you might have seen on Yo! MTV Raps in 1994, but which never tries to soullessly recreate the 90s aesthetic. Music that feels modern but comes from an eternal place. Flee the sirens rap. Blunt scorched, deuces chucked rap. If it ain’t raw it’s worthless rap.
And that’s Vince Ash. 
Visceral and potent, Vince hails from Hammond, Ind., and embodies all that is the Midwest. His world is bleak and sinister, sepia-tinted. Some Do or Die, straight out the mud rap. Or, as Andrew Barber from FakeShoreDrive puts it, “Vince is easily one of the hottest new talents repping Indiana — especially the Northern part of the state. [His style] is eerie and infectious— one that you won’t soon forget. This one has been embedded in my brain since I first heard it, if we’re being factual. [Vince Ash’s] music sticks to your bones. You can feel it in your soul.”
Vince released the critically acclaimed, Do or Die, via POW Recordings in 2018, and is currently recording it’s follow-up due later this year.

shared the same studio class during first period. Jay Denero had recruited Dre Cash to

course of the next two years, most of the members had dropped out of the group and by 
2015 they were down to three artists. 
During this time, the trio had begun performing at local events and showcases in and 
around the Detroit Metro area where they gained a loyal fan base. In December of 
2016, they were invited to perform at Imported from The D, where they won the largest

He’d only been in the country for six years at that point, having fled his birthplace of Bucharest, Romania after his family received death threats from their government. Fast forward years of touring, writing and recording with multiple bands, Holiday landed in the Jersey City art scene and started to release music under his own moniker. 
With a downtown NYC lo-fi sound, written and recorded at his studio in the heart of historic Greenwich Village, Holiday is working towards his upcoming, currently untitled debut album. NYLON declared his debut single Quit Playing Cool as “Uniquely self-aware and poignant.” A feeling that Holiday ironically fights against in his second track Children, which romanticizes the innocence of a less self-aware time. “Lie and say this world is fine / That we will be alright,” he sings in this melancholy, nostalgia driven track. Holiday’s latest “Like in the Movies” was featured on Spotify’s New Music Friday and New Indie Mix playlists.

1803,VOILÀ,"“Refreshing,” “Romantic,” and “Relatable” are a few of the terms used to describe L.A.- based pop/rock act VOILÀ. Gus Ross and Luke Eisner, respectively from London and Wisconsin - combine authentic production, emotive vocals and magnetic lyricism as a duo. 

Ross started out busking around London, which led to playing shows in London’s infamous West End: even performing for the Queen. He is fascinated by the technicality of music and handles production. On the other side of the world, Eisner’s passion for music came through lyricism: fascinated by timeless literature, he fronted bands in the midwest scene. Eisner, also maintains a professional modeling career, which helps craft the duo's aesthetic. Luke also is the lead in an upcoming Netflix original movie, ""Tall Girl,"" produced by McG and coming in Fall of 2019. 

VOILÀ started 2018 as one of BBC Introducing Solent’s “Ones to Watch.” After success on Spotify and BBC radio, the band drew eminent praise from the likes of Billboard, Pandora, Ones to Watch, and more. Their most recent single ""Don't"" debuted at #19 on Spotify's New Music Friday. In 2018 alone, they have supported Kesha, The Fray, and X Ambassadors.

Since first joining forces in 2014, hardware freak Parrish Smith and former punk activist Mark van de Maat (founder of Amsterdam’s admirable Knekelhuis label) have earned a reputation for delivering the kind of incendiary live shows that were once the preserve of British multi-media mavericks such as Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle.
With Smith working a range of hardware gear – three drum machines, two samplers, outboard effects units and a range of vintage synths – and van de Maat adding forthright vocals, the duo has struck up a rapport with live audiences across Europe and beyond. Mutilating and manipulating their songs on the fly, Volition Immanent takes no prisoners in pursuit of artistic expression.
March 2019 they release their 2nd EP on MIND Records, after their last years album and 7""EP. This will put Volition Immanent’s instinctive, do-it-yourself approach to music-making and performance centre stage, offering an insight into their intoxicating brand of no-holds-barred intensity.

Early singles, ‘I For An Eye’ and ‘Wisdom Teeth,’ were fresh and fiercely ambitious, with vocalist Maz De Vita’s unbridled passion and seductively melodic flow full of hooks. 2017’s Wild & Weak EP saw their popularity grow exponentially off the back of tracks like ‘Same Same’ and ‘This Everything,’ as did their striking reputation as a live band. Radio soon stepped up to the plate and carried these honest and hard-nosed new tunes across the globe. Now we land at the next phase of their career and the immense new single ‘Labrador.’ It doesn’t take long listening to realise that once again you’re in brand-new Waax territory in ‘Labrador’ – undeniably the biggest song of their career. Above all else, the focus continues to be drawn to De Vita’s concentrated vocals, sounding smoother and more emotionally raw than ever. “I want to be the voice that I couldn’t hear when I was young,” says De Vita. With songs like ‘Labrador’ in her arsenal, she’s well on her way to achieving that goal.

They started at a time when it was deemed patently absurd to mix the two types of music, but the Wacos knew the score; they are different sides of the same coin, the personal wrapped in the political. And instead of travelling calculated creative boulevards during their career, the Waco Brothers have explored dark alleys and winding gravel paths through nine releases, all with the headlights off and the pedal to the metal, worrying (or not worrying) about end results later. With a body of work known for the indelicate and raucous, this may be their most deliberate and punchy yet—no one’s more dangerous than a man with nothing to lose. The title can be read two different ways, after all.

Wafia joined the Interscope Records duo to perform the song during their sets at Coachella and the stunning Red Rocks Amphitheatre.

In August of 2018, she unveiled the first creation from that process, an upbeat track entitled “I’m Good.” The song was co-written by Wrabel (Ellie Goulding, Adam Lambert), produced by Rogét Chahayed (Travis Scott, Solange) and Grammy-nominated writer/ producer John Hill (Portugal.

Founder Alex Wein (vocals, guitars), moved across the country to heed the immortal clarion call of the West Coast and wasted zero time in recruiting musicians after firmly planting his amps in the Bay Area. Looking to create an aural ash cloud of volcanic rock, Alex solidified this crew with Bay Area natives Joaquin Ridgell (drums), Jesse Serrano (guitar), and Taylor Roach (bass). 
War Cloud may be a young band but they are far from wide-eyed innocents. Their musical history drenched in molten riffs across the timeline of heavy metal, the name alone originates from a Wicked Lady song of the same title. With roots encompassing everything from the modern stoner rock scene by way of classic acts ranging from Led Zeppelin to Angel Witch this is a group who love to dig deep into the beating heart of the underground. War Cloud has created a new flavor of heavy rock music for those enjoying the devilish sounds served up by the likes of Saxon, UFO, Thin Lizzy, and Pentagram.
This is modern metal sophistication dipped deep in ‘70’s heavy fuzz rock.

1828,Western Youth,"Five years in the making, Western Youth’s first full-length album has finally arrived. The band has done a lot of growing up since then, seeing its members through the life changes that accompany waxing youth - weddings, babies, careers, settling down, starting over. 
The self-titled album is colored by these changes, touching on unfulfilled dreams, honest and flawed relationships, an uncertain world - shot through with glimpses of light streaming in through the cracks. 
The result of all this is an evolved but still defiant Western Youth - introspective and poetic, but full of piss and vinegar, a unique sound that staggers artfully between rock n' roll, folk, americana, and something, well, more grown up.

1829,Wet Dreams,"Wet Dreams is a project with people from Death By Unga Bunga, FOAAAM and Warp Riders. The members found a collective interest for modern American psychedelic hard rock and punk, and has done a number of shows in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland after they started up in 2015. Most notably Øyafestivalen in Oslo. 
They released their debut ep, Cartridge Belt in 2017 that got attention far outside of Norway. 
Clash Magazine “Wet Dreams sent the needle into the red so long ago they've forgotten how to get it back. The band specialise in snarling garage punk with a proto-metal sneer, stomping on a never-ending row of Big Muff pedals in the process.”
NME “Imagine Motorhead covering The Hives. Add beer, punk, and stir. Doesn’t that sound fun?”
«77er Punk trifft Sixties Schmelz, herrlich! Für Freunde von Ty Segall, King Gizzard oder Jay Reatard uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen.» Intro.de
Songwriter Sebastian Ulstad Olsen has this to say about the music: «Even if the song structures aren’t miles away from the stuff I write in Death By Unga Bunga, I’ve been longing to challenge the recording and production process. I love music that bend the rules, so Wet Dreams is a great laboratory for this

1831,White Denim,"Less than a year after their last album Performance, the ever-prolific White Denim are back with their eighth record Side Effects. More in line with the experimental, freewheeling spirit of their fan-favourite record Last Day of Summer than anything else they’ve done since, Side Effects is a record that captures the spirit of the band’s full-throttle live shows. Featuring a rotating cast of band members led by James Petralli and Steve Terebecki, these tracks draw on the sounds of different personnel to create a cohesive whole – the result being an album that’s as varied and vivacious as anything they’ve ever done.

The band features singer/guitarist Ava Gore (vocals in the credit soundtrack for the award winning video-game Prey) and singer/guitarist/composer Raphael Colantonio, who has over 2 million YouTube views for his video-game songs (produced by Matt Piersal). Colantonio and Gore have continued their collaboration into beautiful and deep live experiences, where Ava's dark and distinctive voice connects powerfully with Raphael's emotionally grabbing melodies.

1835,Wieuca,"Wieuca is never minimalist. Since 2012, the group has been soaking twang, heavy beats and abstract sampling in heavy, textured layers of sound. Over their 14 releases (to date), the prolific foursome has plugged that aesthetic into styles ranging from alt-country to triphop to full-blown psychedelic freakout. The Baby Boys, as their followers call them, continue to expand their sound with frequent collaborations including tracks with Brooklyn rapper JAVAE, Georgia country artist Zach Wright, and many more.

1836,Wild Moccasins," Fronted by Zahira Gutierrez (vocals/keyboard) and Cody Swann (guitar/vocals), Wild Moccasins’ forthcoming third full-length serves as a new beginning for the group. Look Together tackles themes of repairing relationships, shedding insecurities, and fresh starts, with vibrant guitar/synth lines layered under Gutierrez’s pop melodies. The impassioned 12-track LP began to form merely a week after the release of 2014’s 88 92, as Gutierrez and Swann’s decade-long romantic relationship dissolved.
Healing proved to be difficult, as Wild Moccasins were charted for two years of extensive touring. Gutierrez and Swann would spend countless hours in a shared van, painfully staring each other down on stage and exchanging exaggerated he- said-she-said’s through songwriting.
Gutierrez and Swann began their writing partnership roughly a year into their romantic relationship, in 2007. The group has undergone roster changes over the years, but currently exists with the addition of Avery Davis (drums). Their latest effort is highly pop-powered, with Ben H. Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Deerhunter, Animal Collective) at the production helm.

1837,Wild Ponies,"Although they're based in Nashville, Wild Ponies have always looked to Southwest Virginia — where bandmates Doug and Telisha Williams were both born and raised — for inspiration. There, in mountain towns like Galax, old-time American music continues to thrive, supported by a community of fiddlers, flat-pickers, and fans.
 Wild Ponies pay tribute to that powerful music and rugged landscape with their most recent release Galax, a stripped-back album that nods to the band's history while still pushing forward. Doug and Telisha took some of their favorite musicians from Nashville (Fats Kaplin, Will Kimbrough, Neilson Hubbard and Audrey Spillman) and met up with revered Old-Time players from Galax, Virginia (Snake Smith, Kyle Dean Smith, and Kilby Spencer). Recorded in the shed behind Doug’s old family farm in the Appalachians (steps away from the site where Doug and Telisha were married), it returns Wild Ponies to their musical and geographic roots.

1838,Will Courtney,"After spending five years touring and recording two albums as the lead singer and songwriter of the Austin, TX band, Brothers And Sisters, Will Courtney decided to pack up and move back to Los Angeles...and then to Nashville...and then to a log cabin on some land in Dripping Springs, TX. Now, after two years of being based in Santa Fe, NM, where he produced albums for other artists and toured the US and Europe as a solo artist, he’s back in Austin with a new band and a new album, Crazy Love, on Super Secret Records.
When Will is not making music, he spends much of his time collecting 19th Century photographs and researching the history of the American West.  He recently worked on a new documentary series for the Discovery Channel about famous western outlaws called Gunslingers.  Will is a featured historian on Gunslingers: Billy The Kid.

He has released six full-length albums that seamlessly meld country, blues, folk, and punk styles - spanning from 2003’s Hymns for the Hopeless (Southern Records) to 2015’s Radium Death (ANTI-). His songs are haunting, rustic, powerful, and real – byproducts of living his entire life on the family farm, being involved in the hardcore-punk scene in the local community, and touring hard across the country.

1840,William Harries Graham,"Bill Bentley wrote: ""Sometimes when you walk into a club and hear someone new, life starts all over again. All the years between youth and now fly away into the air and the new songs being played promise an endless joy. William Harries Graham does that every night he sings his own songs, and as long as he does that the world will be a fine place to live. To hear him now is to hear it all."" 
Fresh off a 2018 summer European tour, William's new record JAKES drops in time for SXSW. JAKES is named after the neon sign in the back room of the legendary Continental Club in Austin, TX, where William and his band (featuring Abra Moore, Mike Meadows, David Goodrich, and Andrew Duplantis) play most Wednesdays nights. JAKES was recorded at Wire Studio by platinum engineer Stuart Sullivan. Germany's Blue Rose Records caught William Harries Graham with his band during SXSW 2016 soon releasing his 1st record, Foreign Fields, to Europe. Wired Magazine's listed William as one of “World’s Top Changing Innovator's: 50 People Who Will Change the World. William is finishing his university studies at the University of Texas, Austin in the prestigious Honors Plan II program.

1842,Willie J Healey,"Willie J Healey developed his skills via the old school method of acoustic shows and local support gigs. Being able to record at home only amplified his abilities, and a couple of EPs released on small indie labels attracted the attention of Columbia, who hoped he’d emerge as the next Ed Sheeran.
But as comparisons with everyone from Deerhunter, Kurt Vile and Mac DeMarco to Chris Isaak and Lou Reed emerged, it was clear that he was instead destined to be the one and only Willie J Healey. It was a great experience with some ups and downs, but his goal was more simple and remains unchanged – to be able to write songs that he likes and then share them with audiences. His latest EP set to be released by new music champions YALA! Records.
Everything is now in place for Willie J Healey to live up to his limitless potential. “I try not to be too aware of trends, so I can focus on writing the best song I can regardless of whether I think it will be cool or not.” He notes how the great albums of the ‘70s feel out of time in contrast to the booming drums and slick production that places many ‘80s records firmly within their era. “A timeless classic will never go out of fashion.”

1843,Willie Jones,"4 SOUND / Empire Records recording artist and Black River Publishing songwriter Willie Jones, is a native of Shreveport, LA. Jones grew up loving Country music and remembers wanting to be a Country music artist as early as age 14. Jones released his first single, “Runs In Our Blood” on all streaming platforms, as well as an official music video that premiered exclusively on TheBoot
and WorldStar. “Willie Jones breaks the country music mold on many levels as a fresh new face in
the industry,” stated The Boot earlier this summer. Breaking into Country music, Jones has already
been featured on top Country music playlists from Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, Spotify,
TIDAL and YouTube Music. Jones has toured on the MAGcon Tour featuring artists including Cameron
Dallas, Nash Grier, Shawn Mendes and more....

1845,Will Varley,"WILL VARLEY
Singer-songwriter Will Varley has come a long way since his early days haunting the open mics of South London and busking around on The Underground. After releasing his 5th studio album in 2018, his largely sold out UK tour drew to a close with a triumphant show at London's legendary Shepherd's Bush Empire.
There is a depth to Will's songwriting that sets him apart, and has propelled his music far and wide. From songs like 'The Man Who Fell To Earth' which tells the heart-wrenching story of an Angolan immigrant attempting to enter the UK, to the hyper-engaging 'Weddings and Wars' in which he attempts a history of the world in under four minutes, Varley's songs seem to transcend themselves, marrying vivid imagery, politics, emotion and surrealism to capture his musings in a way that is quite remarkable. 
Over the past few years Will has toured relentlessly across Europe and America as support act for Billy Bragg, Frank Turner, Valerie June and The Proclaimers and he's sold out his own headline shows in cities as far a field as Berlin, Zurich, Amsterdam and Vienna. High praise from the likes of Tim Minchin and Simon Nicol of Fairport Convention have helped fan the flam

1847,Wohl,"Wohl is a four-piece Mexican instrumental band from Guadalajara with a unique musical language that combines a wide variety of influences ranging from metal and rock to Mexican folk and classical music.
""Wohl appeared from nowhere to release a mature, complex and beautiful album"" Picnic Magazine
The band communicates a rich palette of emotions without the need of a spoken narrative, using melodic expression, contrasting dynamics and sonic atmospheres to create a cathartic yet longing statement. 
Their debut album ''En Vida'' (In Life) was launched in 2017 at the The Art and Culture Forum in Guadalajara accompanied by a string quartet (arrangements written by the band itself). Since the release of their debut album in 2017 they have been performing in Mexico solidly. Wohl has been an opening act for international bands like LITE (Japan), Sleep Party People (Denmark), Yndi Halda (England), Delta Sleep (U.K), and Hikes (USA). 
Their new EP by Wohl is due the first half of 2019.
Additionally to SXSW, they are confirmed to showcase at Live at Heart in Sweden in September 2019.

1848,Wolf & Moon,"Wolf & Moon are a duo of modern day storytelling nomads about to release their debut album ‘Before It Gets Dark’ (out 25th Jan 2019). They will be touring Australia, UK, Ireland, Germany and the US in support of the album and to collect and share new stories with local audiences. Wolf & Moon’s music lives of the dichotomy of their voices and marries dreamy indie folk with electronic elements.
The album was recorded when they packed their whole lives into one car and went off for a long Swedish Summer. In Stockholm they met multi-platinum Grammy nominee, John Andersson, who became an instant friend and the producer of the album. Lyrically they take you on a journey through your favourite travel memories. Musically they will make you dream away and personally, they will make you feel like you've been friends for a long time.

1849,Wood & Wire,"With their latest GRAMMY nominated record “North of Despair”, it’s the melding of hard country songwriting with high-octane bluegrass instrumentation that makes for Austin, TX based Wood & Wire’s signature sound. Tony Kamel, Trevor Smith, Dominic Fisher, & Billy Bright cut these tunes live to tape with minimal editing bringing the well known ferocity of their live shows, and an impromptu joy to each track - a joy that developed out of playing over 150 shows a year since 2014. This is really their first studio record since they began touring nationally, making it their most definitive to date. Booking now for 2019, these guys have developed a solid reputation of giving joyous and heartfelt performances, often described as having the best of both the traditional and progressive sounds, with a unique backbeat feel influenced by Texas sounds they’ve honed in over the years.

1852,Worn-Tin,"‘Lo-fi lullaby maker Worn-Tin is just a boy who grew up skating in West LA with his imaginary friend Cool-son,’ as described by Citizine. Worn-Tin, AKA Warner (a friend drunkenly called him “Worn-Tin”) began writing and playing original music during his high school days in Santa Monica, California. He eventually built a backyard studio where he writes, records, and performs every element of his songs using only analog and outboard equipment, taking inspiration from a multitude of artists such as Modest Mouse, R. Stevie Moore and Jessie’s Candy and The Fit Bit.

Much like Worn-tin’s hyperactive mind, his sounds and lyrics are sprawling: his vocals range from the type of cadence and vulnerability that would make Dongo the ringworm smile, to distorted, psychedelic whaling and synths. 

That same lucid unpredictability has become the staple for his live shows. At a Worn-Tin show, it’s not only about the music - you can expect a performance. from drinking his own urine to getting arrested on stage.

When not feverishly writing new music, Worn-Tin can be found skating, gardening or crying in the attic.

1854,Wyclef Jean,"The music that Wyclef Jean has written, performed, and produced — both as a solo superstar and as founder and guiding member of the Fugees — has been a consistently powerful, pop cultural force for over two decades. In 1996, the Fugees released their monumental album The Score. As a solo artist, Wyclef has released seven albums that have sold nearly nine million copies worldwide, including his 1997 debut The Carnival and 2000’s aptly titled The Eclectic: 2 Sides II a Book. Jean’s latest studio album, Carnival III: The Fall and Rise of a Refugee, his first in eight years, was released on Sept. 15, 2017. The album was named one of the “25 Most Anticipated Albums” of the fall by Billboard Magazine that year. In December, Wyclef wrote and performed a song, “Dimelo,” along with X-Factor winners, Rak-Su. The song rose to the top of the charts in less than a week in the UK. Wyclef is currently working on a new project, Wyclef Goes Back to School, which is a collaboration with students he met while touring the United States and visiting colleges across the country.

1858,XETAS,"Forming in 2015 after steeling their styles in the hotbed of Austin's Red River music scene, axe-masters David Petro (Debt, Neighbor) and Kana Harris (Foreign Mothers) coupled their admiration for each other's musical tastes and stubborn adherence to DIY ethics into art-rock firebrands XETAS. After releasing a 7"" (""The Silence/The Knife"" aka ""the Rat Trap 7"""") and LP (The Redeemer) less than a year after forming, drummer Matt Buie relocated to DC, so they enlisted Houston newcomer Jay Dilick (Super Thief, Uncle Jesus) to join up. 2017 sophomore effort ""The Tower"" shows the band solidifying their sound and was well-received, building anticipation to their 3rd LP due 2019 on Matador dude Gerard Cosloy's personal label, 12XU. Having spent most of 2017 and 2018 touring (and documenting - XETAS made and released a tour documentary using only their cell phones and free software) it's obvious this band works hard and knows what they're about. A successful run of dates with Superchunk, Speedy Ortiz, and Proud Parents in 2018, and rumors of touring with Built to Spill in 2019, I highly recommend you mess with XETAS.

1860,XIXA,"For their new, four-track EP XIXA - Tucson’s dark, dusty gothic overlords - reached further into the desert, into their instruments, and into their words to carve a more grandiose space for their cumbia-tinged psychedelic rock to swell. The guitar-slinging six-piece from the deep Southwest combine gritty guitars, the bumping grind of chicha, and windswept desert blues into a mesmerizing stew, The Code being the next step in their evolution. A swirling, raw collection of songs, intense and sun bleached yet shot through with an inky gothic horror, it’s XIXA at their potent, eclectic best.

1862,XXX,"""A direct opposition to the established formula of making music in South Korea"" - Billboard
""Most of the South Korean music that reaches the West has been determinedly poppy, perfectly groomed and eager to please. The hip-hop duo XXX has other, far more confrontational plans"" - The New York Times
""XXX take cues from their own culture and mash them up with weirder found sounds, proving that Korean rap can innovate, not just replicate"" - Pitchfork
South Korea's groundbreaking producer/rapper duo XXX recently released 'Second Language', the direct follow-up album to their innovative debut Language, and the second half of the duo's two-disk double album. The new album builds on the statement of sonic dissonance from mainstream Korean music that bilingual rapper Kim Ximya and producer FRNK made with their debut. The duo channel their anger and discontent with the preconceived formula of Korean pop hits into dense new layers of hip hop and instrumentation. With their new album, XXX aims to push the envelope even further as the torchbearers for this new direction of Korean hip-hop.

1864,yahyel,"An electronica music unit from Tokyo, Japan, formed in early 2015.
Combining fragile lyrics with dark soundscapes, yahyel paint potent portraits of life, peppered with both dystopian imagery and blistering honesty. Their music is described as a “musical cyber punk” in modern counter culture towards the stereotype of East.
Released in May 2015, the group's first online demo Y and in November 2016, they had the sensational debut with their first studio album “Flesh and Blood” released and they played Fuji Rock Festival 2 years in row. They were invited to play the 2018 SXSW Opening Party and have performed at the legendary Rough Trade East in the UK. In March yahyel released their second album “HUMAN”. It rose No.1 on the electro music chart of Apple Music Japan and their single “Rude” was picked for Future Classic Recommends on Youtube. A band member VJ Kento had won several awards for best director including an MTV award, and his contribution of stunning visuals as a backdrop turn yahyel’s live performances into an experience that is equally haunting as it is dance party. MTV Japan reviewed their performance as “gripping” and “a unique experience not to be missed"".

Yawners is pop and powerful guitars, an energy that instantly brings you back to the Weezer, Pixies and The Breeders 90s era while still reminding you of newer bands like Waxahatchee or Big Thief. Since her first self-released EP in 2015, ‘Dizzy’, she has developed the project between Germany and Spain under a mostly DIY philosophy and has toured Europe and Spain in several occasions, recently playing FIB Benicàssim and BBK Live. She has made her way into the UK scene being featured on BBC Radio and her work has been recognized by international magazines such as the English Record Collector. With two new singles just released, ‘Seaweed’ and ‘Arco Iris’, Yawners just announced her debut album on La Castanya to be released in March 2019.

Some might recall edges of the mid-1900s Delta blues, but only if those lived-in riffs were played by the MC5, broadcast through booming stadium speakers and drenched with pounds of fuzzy distortion and full-throttled punk rock energy. They conduct parallel frequencies with the ferocious and raw proletarian roots of Uncle Tupelo, the burning-hot thrashings and cavernous sonic space of Hot Snakes, and mix in derisive scrutiny that brings to mind Ween or the Minutemen (and might we add that Cook is the spitting image of D.

1868,YEHAIYAHAN,"In the decade that’s passed since YEHAIYAHAN (also known as ChaCha) first found her sound with legendary Shanghai bass crew Sub-Culture, she has become one of China’s most prolific, dynamic, and magnetic independent musicians. Virtually none of her peers have clocked as many collaborations with world-renowned underground tastemakers — international names like Clive Chin, Kode9, Jimi Tenor and Matthieu Chedid, as well as homegrown heroes J-Fever, Lil Akin and Soulspeak, to name a few — nor as many high-profile appearances at music festivals and industry showcases around the world. Though she came up in the sound worlds of hip-hop, Soul, dub, bass, and trip-hop,  Her sound has evolved greatly in the 10+ years that she’s been making music, but YEHAIYAHAN heart, soul, and fiercely independent spirit are the constants that mark her out to this day as one of China’s most important and extraordinary musical talents.

Originally from Abbottabad, Pakistan – infamous for the capturing of Osama Bin Laden - ZĀN’s artistry comes from an intersectional socio-political identity; a queer muslim voice from the South Asian diaspora – or what ZĀN likes to term, Queeristan. Both an ode and resistance to the Australian migrant parable, ZĀN’s voice is desperately needed in the current music landscape and is a symbol of what it means to exist across social, cultural and political borders.

ZRN premiered their current set up as a duo at Copenhagen Psych Fest 2016, and have since had a busy live calendar in and outside of Denmark - including support for Bell Witch, Ulan Bator, Esben & the Witch - among others.
The duo has been featured twice on Drowned in Sound's ""Some Velvet Mixtape"" and Performed at WNIM'17.

Formed within the budding music scene of Tulsa, Oklahoma, ZUNIS built their name and following in the Tulsa music scene by curating and fronting all-ages shows around Tulsa. Where the music scene has a number of good places to play, but virtually no good all-ages venues. Thru their platform of all ages shows, backed by their philosophy of good entertainment for all ages, ZUNIS solidified themselves as major players in the local music scene by making events happen for music lovers in Tulsa. ZUNIS experienced firsthand the lack of all ages entertainment in Tulsa and pledged to change that by making shows happen. Be it a warehouse, a friends backyard, or the living room of your mom's suburban home, the show must always go on. Because (for Tulsans) the show wouldn't be happening anywhere else.
