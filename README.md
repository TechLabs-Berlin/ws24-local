# CD into Local folder

React-native
Expo (to visualize the app, I used expo go and/or iOS Simulator)
# You might nneed to install additional libraries like:
react-native-async
@react-navigation/native
@react-navigation/bottom-tabs
@expo/vector-icons { MaterialIcons, MaterialCommunityIcons, Fontisto, Entypo, Feather, FontAwesome, Ionicons [didn't manage to access/use Material-Symbols, therefore I had to use so many Icon-Families to get the ones more similar to the ones needed] } 
@expo-google-fonts/inter {Inter_400Regular, Inter_700Bold, Inter_500Medium, Inter_300Light }

# npx expo start -c

for the server:

# CD into local3
# install dependencies {if needed}
venv, Flask, jsonify, request, python3
Pandas
CORS
re

# python3 /your_directory_folder/local3/local_api3.py


you will find a couple of extra files for the things I was trying but didnt manage to get to work.

# change API url and port before the endpoint in: 
Bookmarkhelper
SearchData
SavedPage
HomePage
EventCard
# .js files to point to your local flask
