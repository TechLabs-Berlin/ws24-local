##WD Track

I admit, starting out alone was a bit nerve-wracking. Without a partner to bounce ideas off of or troubleshoot with, the workload seemed a tad overwhelming. To get going, I started piecing together something based on the project presentation wireframes. It was a clever workaround, saving me from waiting on the actual wireframes. But, as with most things, there were pros and cons. On the upside, having certain components prepped, like the search bar and event cards, was a boon. However, once I needed to split them up, everything seemed to unravel. It wasn't as simple as dividing the code into two files as I'd anticipated. In fact, it took considerable effort to reassemble them. What's more, a file that initially served as a renderer morphed into a multipurpose file over time, leading to a frustrating circularity I couldn't untangle on my own. Thankfully, a friend lent a hand with that conundrum.

Throughout the coding process, certain themes and patterns emerged. Initially, progress was a bit stuttering, and the longer I stared at the code, and the longer one sat at it sometimes the more the problems! Thankfully a night of sleep will refresh thy mind (import refresh from 'react-native/mind-refresher/sleep). Finding solutions to unfamiliar problems and debugging became integral parts of the journey. The sheer number of times I was confronted with error-messages and that was spent on trying to fix  things (and trying to fix the fixes, with incompatibilities, deprecations and so on) forced me to hone a new skill: articulating my issues effectively in search queries to unearth relevant solutions.

In hindsight, I learned that coding demands meticulous planning, logical structuring, and breaking tasks down into manageable chunks. It's a lesson I'll carry forward. If you think you've planned enough, plan some more. And if it feels like overkill, well, plan a bit more anyway. Besides that, working with Can on the backend and having to find solutions to get front end and back end to work has been a pleasant journey.
